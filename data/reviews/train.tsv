deceptive	staying at the sofitel was one of the less pleasurable experiences i have had in chicago. upon entering, there was no one offered to take my luggage so i was forced to carry it up to the check in desk. the front desk staff was not friendly or welcoming. the room was smaller than i expected and smelled of fake suede. i decided to have drink and some food in le bar and upon entering, i immediately noticed how dimly lit the room was. i could barely see the bartenders face. the drinks were alright and the food was sub-par compared to what i was expecting. after an hour, i was ready for bed so i returned to my room to lay down. the mattress was surprising stiff. the noise was higher than expected as well. thankfully, it was only a one night stay.
truthful	"i have stayed at the omni off an on over the years. on business, for personal trips. this trip started off quite rocky, and left me very un-impressed. 1) be aware, they have a new policy where they charge debit card $55 per day for ""incidentals"" which you *may* incur. they do this if you elect not to use a standard credit card. even if you have booked and paid for your room in advance. the desk clerk claimed ""all the hotels do this now""...funny how when i put a remote employee at the o'hare hilton on my business debit card, i was never asked for additional funds. having a policy is one thing, spreading blame for it is another. while not a problem for me, someone who plans trips down to the dollar and dime might encounter a problem with this ""policy"" of theirs. to my knowledge, they never did this sort of thing before. (i don't use credit cards, its why i have money in a recession. =)) 2) rooms were clean, but their in room accoutrements and mini bar items had no price list. the only thing labelled with a price was a bottle of water (about 600 ml) for $7.50. as such, be careful with the tray of goodies. if the water is $7.50, imagine what the snickers bar might cost. 3) our suite had a bathroom sliding door between the bedroom and bathroom which appeared broken, and would not move. calling the front desk resulted in ... nothing. finally about 9:00 pm i elected to have another look at it, and it seemed to be off its track. i was able to successfully ""fix"" it, but the lack of response from maintenance, considering the rate for a suite, is sad. i remember this hotel being much more attentive and responsive. 4) the seem to cut a lot of corners on room stocking now. overall, i think i will be skipping the omni, and they will get no more of my business. it seems hilton treats people better overall. it's quite sad, as i have a lot of good memories with omni. i will not be back."
truthful	"i just had a conference there. they have bed bugs--i have all these bug bites and it itches like hell. food wise, we had chicken both times for lunch (maybe my company was saving some $) but they should at least prepare them differently. it looked like they did the same style chicken but change the underlying ""bed"" upon which it is served. for dinner, we had filet mignon and crab cake. sounds good right? wrong! the filet mignon seems to be 1/2 the thickness of what i have seen and it was tough. i thought the filet mignon is suppose to be tenderest part of the cow???? also, the crab cakes was a bit too salty. finally the portions were tiny and left me lacking. in asking my co-worker, most seem to be blase about the food. however, some seem to like the burger (which they went to substitute) at the palms, which is a restaurant inside the hotel, just off the lobby. on the positive note, the dessert for dinner was good. otherwise, i'd recommend another hotel. in the meantime, when i got home, i make sure to bring everything straight to the washer/dryer to disinfect (even strip down). but, damn, i'm still itchin'"
truthful	perfect location, clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay. its in an area with plenty of stores ( the mile) and restaurants. hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall i would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family, friends or on business. the subway to wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door.
deceptive	i frequently have business meetings in downtown chicago and find that the hotel monaco chicago, gives me the peace of mind to make those meetings enjoyable. while it might be more expensive than your average hotel....but there is nothing average in this hotel. exceeds any expectations - service, food, quality, atmosphere were heads above anywhere. thanks for making my trips to chicago - the best of the best.
deceptive	when you stay at a hotel like the james, just from their price point, you expect a certain level of quality. if i pay well over 500 dollars for a room, i do not think it unreasonable to expect not only a quality room, but also a certain level of standard of service. perhaps this hotel should rename itself the lebron james, because it has about as much class as he does, and is about twice as pretentious. a handful of baby powder thrown into my face would have been a refreshing break from the level of service i received at the lebron james. my night of hell began with the clerk, bellboy, or whatever he was, at the front desk, who faked what i assume was intended to be a british accent, but ended up as an unholy melding of australian and new englander. a british accent does not make you fancy, or skilled. once i made my way past mr. belvedere and to my room, i was disappointed, not only by its size, which was unusually small, but also a faint scent of cigarettes. not a strong one, but i could definitely smell smoke. not acceptable. then, while i was sleeping, a deep throbbing sound began to emanate from the walls. it sounded technical, mechanical, like an air conditiner malfunctioning. despite many reassurances from the front desk, the throbbing continued on throughout the night. i demanded the man at the front desk come up and rectify the situation immediately, but from what i could tell, he never came.
truthful	we had a great experience at this hotel. the hotel is huge! the rooms were very clean, well appointed, and our room was very roomy with a great view of the snow covered park. the staff was so nice and very helpfull. donald, at the the concierge desk scored us tickets to wicked the day of the performance, and on a holiday weekend too. they were great seats and a reasonable price. he worked very hard for us to see that show. they truely topped off what was a fun new years celebration. this will be my first pick when i return in the spring.
truthful	we were checked into a room with empty beer bottles, dirty underwear in the closet and unclean bathroom. there was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints. we missed our show because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc. finally when i got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles especially when i had a child and a teenager with me she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience!!! staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night. they kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets. i asked for two blanket , but they delivered one. i had to keep calling to get settled. i saw a comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk, who had taken the trouble of filling it out, but no one collected it or cared for it. ht. noisy rooms. can hear the doors all night. thebreakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished. i will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates!!
truthful	"thirty years ago, we had a tiny ""room"" and indifferent service. this time, the service was superb and friendly throughout, with special commendation for the waiters and waitresses at the coffee shop, the door and bell persons, and the hilton honors person at the front desk. they even lowered our price (to moderately high) when we inquired a few days before our stay. when we want to stay south of the river downtown, we will be back"
deceptive	"we really enjoyed our stay at the palmer house hilton. we were in chicago for a weekend stay, and wanted something close to state street, and convenient to the theatre district and the museums, and michigan ave. shopping. this is a grand old hotel, with just about every amenity one could wish for. the lobby is fabulous, and the hotel also has some nice restaurants . our room had a nice king sized bed, and was pretty cozy. hotel employees were very nice and helpful to us. i would definitely recommend this hotel if you want a ""grand hotel"" type experience at a reasonable price for the many amenities and in a very convenient spot in downtown chicago. you will definitely feel special."
truthful	stayed at the intercontinental for an entire week on business and for the most part a very elegant, convenient visit. stayed in the historic tower. very nice rooms, great view, attentive staff, convenient location just north of the tribune tower & the river, and nice fitness club at $16 for the entire stay. the only downside is i couldn't get over the feeling that i was being nickle & dimed: $10 a day for wi-fi, $6 bottles of water in the room, $26 mini-bottle of wine in the fridge, tipping multiple staff for carrying the same bags, etc. their in-house restaurant zest is zagat rated though i'm not sure why. within a 5 minute walk there are plenty of great restaurants with much better food than zest. but, next time i need to be near the loop i'd stay at the intercontinental again.
deceptive	after a recent stay at the talbott hotel in chicago, i left the city with an empty pocket book. i had booked a package deal online and although the service was absolutely terrific, i didn't realize some of the amenities i was paying for included personalized key cards and room service menus. i could have done with out my room key having my name printed across it as well as the menu. when did my name printed on things become an extra amenity that cost so much money? i basically felt overcharged for the so called 'extras' included in the package i purchased. one other thing, the traffic was pretty horrible and checking in seems like it could have somehow been made simpler.
truthful	the omni was chosen for it's location whichworked out perfectly. the bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean ...until...i sat down in the tub...there was black mold in the soap holder, in the cracks on the walls between the tile, all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl. needless to say i drained the tub and took a shower...i really don't care for showers. oh yes...the toilet leaked as well...the staff were very helpful but i was disappointed. i travel extensively and don't think i will return. we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken, so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel, printed the presentation and delivered it to our room. they try! we booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building...but we weren't there too much.
truthful	"i'd been searching for a cool, non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. i thought i'd found a winner in the affinia... soo disappointed!! in spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults, we arrived to find our room had a double bed. what?! i was floored, but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride, was too tired to make a fuss. we were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night, so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. i was told that room service would call me back to take my order...and nothing happened. i didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs. nothing special; entree, dessert and nab for two still came out to $*...i am no hayseed, i'm well aware that everything costs more in chicago, but this just wasn't worth it. our room was by the elevator w/ parking garage view...the bathroom was tiny, shower curtain was stained, funky toilet seat/lid, and the vanity featured that ""rude awakening"" lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms, i.e., ""holy crap, have i looked that bad this whole time?!"" if you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker, they charge for their chintzy coffees (i don't use these, but... come on). nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar, but weak drinks... that night, our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that i almost asked to switch rooms. but the marathon was that weekend; the hotel was so busy i didn't want to be a pest. i can't believe i was so impressed with this place online. next time i'll happily pay more to stay someplace that's actually a treat."
truthful	stayed at this hotel with 3 friends or 4 nights. the hotel was clean and tidy, throughout. the concierge christopher was excellent and helped as with all our needs, gave us discount vouchers etc. hotel was in excellent position. 3 blocks from john hancok building and more importantly the cheesecake factory , bloomingdales 3 blocks away and the water tower shopping centre 2 blocks away. we went to the huge i max cinema which is about ten minutes away. cant wait to go back to chicago and the affinia
truthful	the james hotel is located close to everything in chicago, the miracle mile, pizza house uno,rush street, the water tower everything. we walked everywhere because everything was close by. the rooms are very modern and a little on the small side. but the bed was very comfortable, very! the service is very good and the calls are answered professionally and nicely. all service was very fast and through. the lobby is a liitle small but that keeps the riff raff from hanging out in it, the bar service was good. the drink prices were high but what do you expect in a hotel bar. i got a great deal from leading hotels of the world for my stay of 3 days was just over $400.00 for a 5 star hotel that's cheap. due to the location, price and service i may stay there again. but i think my next trip may take me to trump's hotel in chi town. the james is a good stay . the doorman at the hotel are great! always pleasent, with a smile and very good service.
deceptive	i was going to chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops. i did some research and believed the intercontinental would suit my needs. i sure was not disappointed by my decision! this hotel lots of historic charm. despite being a larger hotel, the service was top shelf! the rooms, while not large by any means, were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable. my kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered. as for me, i was more impressed with the location to the magnificent mile. the hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site. the food was very good and, just like the hotel itself, the restaurant provided perfect customer service. dollar for dollar, the intercontinental in chicago is a great deal and i will be staying there again.
deceptive	this hotel was full of drunks. the lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy. there were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night, yelling in the hallways, making lots of noise. the staff had little to say. i wasn't aware of the noise level when i booked the room and when i threatened to make other reservations, the people in the lobby had nothing to say. we asked for a water view and got a city view. again, the people at the front desk weren't accomodating at all. overall, we had a horrible experience.
deceptive	this hotel gives you a lot for a reasonable price! it has a great downtown location and a lot of added bonuses. we loved the evening cocktail hour with free alcoholic beverages and appetizers. they also have complimentary breakfast and complimentary dinner. the fitness center was very clean, i didn't want to leave it! our room was a spacious suite with a kitchen included! and i took advantage of the free grocery delivery. beds are comfortable and the room looks like it was recently renovated. but the thing that really stood out was the teamwork of such a wonderful staff. we will be back to the homewood suites the next time we come to chicago!
truthful	beautiful historic hotel -- and since i'm in historic building business, was looking forward to stay. moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite, they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom, lamp fixtures literally falling off wall, mirror torn off wall, etc. ended up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer, but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions. only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors, so you can be stuck waiting for ever. when i raised this to hotel staff, was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it. umm, no. this is not an old building problem, this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it. thumbs way down, stay away. go to the drake or knickerbocker if you're looking for old world charm, sans hassle.
deceptive	"on our first trip to chicago, my fiance and i stayed 2 nights on our anniversary and were pleasantly surprised by the hotel and the service we received from the personnel. in the past from other ""luxury hotels"" we have paid much more and received much less. here the room were very spacious, comfortable and sleek. we spent come time in the hotel bar, le bar, and enjoyed a few of their specialty martinis that were second to none! we also enjoyed dinner at the hotel's cafe des architectes and received service some of the best service in quite some time. if traveling with a lover we recommend the ""air of romance"" package. it was the best! 6 stars!"
truthful	my friend book this hotel for us for a girls weekend in chicago. lets just say we were thankful we didn't have to spend much time in the room. the carpet was so stained it looked like it was suppose to be that way. the furniture was worn and outdated. the place was gross and just wasn't worth the money we spent on it. the only redeeming quality was the door man, we was very nice and helpful.
truthful	we stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business, part family fun trip in july. we were very impressed with the location, within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping, inlcuding water tower place (a great mall!). we were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size. the bedspreads were filthy and so thin. the room decor is in dire need of an upgreade. the bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew. the shower actually had mold in the corners! this was a very tight squeese for 4 people. especially the bathroom. the beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable. even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit 6 people! thank goodness there were a few elevators. luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price. the only upside was the great location. also beware- its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle! millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab!
deceptive	my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was by far the worst hotel stay i ever had. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. they promised i would be able to relax in the spa area and it was dirty and not relaxing at all. when i got to my room i ordered room service and it took them 45 minutes to bring what i ordered. i am highly dissatisfied.
deceptive	when my new fiance told me about his business trip to chicago i was quite annoyed. mostly because he insisted i come along. he made up for me so not wanting to come along and be alone all weekend, with this wonderful hotel. his mother told him all about this hotel when she and her husband stayed here in the summer of 2008. she loved it..and so did i! i was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend, but the decor, wonderful staff and massages made up for it! i spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and couldn't have asked for a better experience! i am definately coming along on the next business trip!
truthful	"my family has dubbed the omni in chicago ""fawlty towers"" because there always seems to be something wrong. this time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long. it smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing. the bedroom window was bolted shut, so we couldn't get any fresh air into the room. with the amount that the omni is charging for a room, they should have a much better ventilation system."
deceptive	i've stayed at other hotels in chicago, but this was the first absolutely horrifying experience. first off the staff was incredibly rude. i could have lived with that being that it was busy, but when the person would not get off their cell phone while a was checking in it had me wanting to pull my hair out. the room was also horrid. it smelled like sex and cigar smoke so bad in there that i was convinced a politician had just checked out after using it for a cheap affair. there was also what looked to be dried snot on the shower curtain. mark my words: never again will i stay at this dump!
truthful	this hotel was chosen for me for a business convention. the lobby was pretty cool. but the rooms were tiny and very dark. i had a huge picture of kiss above my toilet. it was very hard to do my makeup or read because of the lighting. the location is ok. you have to walk a few blocks to get to the best part of michigan ave, but its not too bad. be prepared for some sad sights after dark. apparently panhandling is permitted in chicago ( some cities will give you a ticket for begging) because at night, the beggars come out. the saddest thing i saw was an older woman with her two grandkids sitting on a curb in the freezing snow on a -5 temp night. those kids looked terrible. unfortunatly its all up and down the wealthiest part of the city. you don't see so many in the daylight. also the room service at the hard rock is pretty good. its plenty for 2 people. i would not stay here again though. i suggest the omni hotel.
truthful	"didn't get the room we were promised. kind of room we had reserved (2 queens) ""wasn't available. they then squeezed 3 adult ladies into 2 singles and a blow-up bed. had to pile furniture on top of tables to get it in! very unsatisfactory!! will not return, will not recommend. will tell people going to chicago to not stay in your hotel. when i next visit paris nextspring, i intend to stop at your world headquarters to tell them what i think of the chicago facility."
deceptive	i went to chicago on business last year and i had the pleasure of staying at the luxurious hyatt regency hotel. i opted for the business plan, although they have many different room descriptions available to choose from, such as the allergy friendly, monarch suite, state suite, all the way up to the presidential suite. my suite was a perfect blend of business and comfort, equipped with wi-fi, a generous 37 inch television, spacious work area and two queen sized beds you sink into feeling tension ease from your body. i dined at the stetson's chop shop restaurant and the meal was portioned generously and very well prepared. the staff was curtious and accommodating. for breakfast, i opted to have my meal brought to my room where i started my business day over a delicious hot meal and strong, gourmet coffee. i would highly recommend this wonderful haven to anyone planning an overnight chicago stay.
truthful	my daughter and i woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. when we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. i then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. both were out of service!!!! i am glad there wasn't an emergency. as we were exited the pool area i ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back. one more thing, in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table. within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding. they need to update this piece of furniture.
deceptive	the downtown chicago hilton was the best combination of all the things we were looking for in a hotel- perfect location for both those of us who like shopping and those of us who prefer tourist attractions. staying with a hilton means the essentials are never a concern- as always, the room was clean and impeccably neat, the staff friendly and very capable. the wireless access and big flat screen tv were an added plus too! best of all, it is a pet-friendly hotel, something that is unusual in bigger city 4-diamond hotels. thanks, chicago hilton, for a great stay!
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel was a delight to stay in. the second you step into the place, it takes your breath away. it's very modern with an antique twist. the rooms are spacious and comfortable. they are clean. every member of the staff was courteous and polite. proud of their place of work. happy to be there. you don't often see that. the room service was phenomenal. visiting chicago was amazing, and staying at the omni hotel made my visit that much better. the luxurious pools were an added plus as well. i also enjoyed the gym facilities. i will definitely be staying at the omni hotel on my next visit.
deceptive	the ambassador east hotel in chicago is a fantastic up-scale hotel to stay in while visiting the windy city. my fiancee and i enjoyed one of the king rooms on our recent stay. the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful - some of the best i've ever dealt with when traveling, and valet parking is always a perk! the rooms were very nice and had all the amenities you would want when at a high-end hotel. the bed was extremely comfortable! there was cable tv, of course, and hbo was included, so there was always something to watch. wireless internet signal was excellent and i had no trouble getting online. we had dinner in the hotel restaurant twice during our stay, and the food was fantastic! great atmosphere as well - we usually only do the hotel restaurant one night on a stay, but this one was worth going back to! overall, it was an incredible stay, and we hope to stay at the ambassador east again next time we're in chicago!
deceptive	after recent week stay at the affinia hotels, i can definitely say i will be coming back. they offer so many in room amenities and services, just a very comfortable and relaxed place to be. my most enjoyable experience at the affinia hotel was the amazing customization they offered, i would recommend affinia hotels to anyone looking for a nice place to stay .
deceptive	the stunning bay at chicago finds its equal in the ambassador east hotel. this hotel feels like luxury was built into everything, down to the wonderful room service and conference rooms. besides being in an active neighborhood in chicago, the ambassador east is close enough to the action and beautiful sights chicago has to offer. the overall service of the hotel was wonderful. i felt like i was treated as a king. the room was very neat, regal, and relaxing. i especially liked the bathroom as it was clean and soothing. the pump room was also a great place for excellent dining. my stay here was completely enjoyable while maintaining a high level of productivity. overall, the stay here was fantastic and worth every penny. i would return to the ambassador east hotel in a heartbeat if given the opportunity.
truthful	we booked the amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in chicago. the hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location. however, when i booked the hotel i was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only $10 more. that was great until i checked in. the corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley. during the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley. it would seem that this is a place for them to congregate. on top of this, the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between 5 and 6 am in the morning. the noise was crazy loud. i think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location. the staff is extremely friendly and very helpful.
truthful	my wife and i just spent 3 nights at the talbott. the room was spacious, comfortable and well-appointed. the hotel is quiet although there is some construction nearby. linens and towels first-class. free wi-fi in the room. the location is terrific, just one block to michigan avenue. we will stay here on future visits.
deceptive	if you are ever going to visit chicago and need a place to stay i recommend this hotel. this hotel made my stay in chicago one that i will always remember. the rooms were very big and luxurious, everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service. the room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so i could get anything whenever i wanted. the price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because i got great service and i saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite. if you are ever going to be in the chicago area and need a hotel to stay in i recommend this hotel!
truthful	maybe it was because we booked thru priceline that we were treated like second rate guest - couldn't get a room thru fairmont website as busy weekend with ryder cup.....but never have had this experience in using priceline before. the night time check in girl was rude and unhelpful. we were told no options to pay for upgrade or king bed and that we were stuck with two tiny beds and a ugly room. we had comforter with dirt in several places - and a bathroom for handicap with no counter space - had to use ironing board for toiletries. this hotel is huge and not at capacity - may have had a renovation but the good look of this hotel stops at the lobby. hallways, rooms, carpet run down - just not what you come to expect of a fairmont. i have stayed in many all over the world and this is by far the worst. maybe because we were on a low floor it was not updated...we paid as much as other guest and i'm a fairmont gold member. positives - great location, daytime staff helpful at desk - they have two bikes to borrow which is handy. views could be great if you get a higher room. checked out the raddison blu across street - looked much nicer!!!
deceptive	my wife and me stayed in the amalfi hotel chicago last august in a weekend visit to chicago. the hotel is located in the 20 w kinzie st, in the well-known river north district. we got what the hotel promised: gentle staff, a luxury room with a breathtaking view, magnificent meals and a select wine. i also used its well-equipped gymnasium. we paid $586 with taxes for two nights. i think it was a good price, taking in account the excellent conditions we got there. i would recommend the amalfi hotel to anybody with good taste that visits chicago.
deceptive	i was extremely disappointed with my stay at the omni chicago hotel. it was a hot summer day and i turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out. i called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it. i felt the person i spoke to was rude to me. they were not accepting responsibility, but talking down to me as if i was stupid. after waiting 30 minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower. this was not a service person. he could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem i was having. he expected a tip and complained when i did not give him one. nobody came up after that. i was told i could switch to a different room, so i had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor. the shower did work in this other room, but i didn't have the view of the city that i had in the first room. i was looking at a brick wall. plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night. i complained and the hotel staff told me they were vips and could not do anything about the noise. this hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable. do not go to the omni hotel. i've stayed in $50 a night motels with better service.
deceptive	recently i traveled to chicago for business. i was treated to a stay at the intercontinental chicago by my employer. it truly says something about your company when they are willing to go the extra mile to make time away from family and friends as comfortable and as relaxing as possible for you. i was greeted by a series of smiling faces that were employed at the hotel and all were eager to help. i checked in at the amazingly lavish lobby and was escorted by hotel staff who assisted me with my bags up to my room. my room was dripping with taste. the stylish room was only made more accommodating by the amenities it offered. with a mini-bar, large flat-screen television, and an entire home office setup, i barely had to leave the room. why would i want to with the amazing views of the lake and entire city. what an amazing experience i had and i will gladly come back.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the omni chicago hotel and it was awful. when i arrived my room was not ready. two hours later when it was finally cleaned, i entered and saw they they had not brought the cot that i had requested for my son. i asked for it again, but they never brought it. my mattress was uncomfortable, and i did not like sharing it with my son. the ac did not even work and it was terribly hot in the room. the next morning we ate the continental breakfast before leaving, and it too was bad. there was cereal, low quality yogurt, and burnt flavorless muffins. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
deceptive	"my husband and i snagged a great deal on a weekend trip to chicago, and decided (at the recommendation of friends) to stay at the palmer house hilton. the only word we can use to describe it is ""amazing""! walking into the lobby feels like stepping back in time, it is simply breath-taking. be sure to check out the ceiling, i have never seen one so beautiful outside of europe. we checked-in without any issues and were assigned a very lovely room with the most comfortable bed i have encountered in any hotel. everything is in walking distance of the palmer house, you couldn't hope to find a better location for exploring downtown chicago. everything was perfect with our stay here, i would not stay anywhere else in chicago from now on."
truthful	"has gone downhill so much we almost checked out. we stayed in the dean martin celebrity suite for 3 nights while entertaining customers in chicago. we've stayed there for many years and while not up to date like the four seasons or the peninsula, it has always been a comfortable and clean, service oriented hotel. not only has room service been eliminated (if you want room service it comes from marios italian restaurant down the street, so is only italian), complimentary morning coffee is no longer available, mini bars have been removed from the rooms, etc. etc. the only restaurant, the pump room was closed for a private function on saturday night, the bar also, so we weren't even able to have an after dinner drink with our guests. surely the function was planned before we made our reservations, but we weren't told of it. we also learned that the bell staff (who have been there for 13 and 8 years) is being eliminated. so, in other words, anyting to do with ""service"" is gone from this hotel. i hear they are going to begin renovations in december, but that is no excuse to let an old glory ""go to pot"" in the meantime. we won't be staying here when we go back in july or for thanksgiving. we even had to pay for internet. mind you, our bill for 3 nights was 900.00+, no room service, no restaurant/bar charges. highway robbery for what you get ow at the ambassador east. sad."
truthful	i booked two rooms four months in advance at the talbott. we were placed on the top floor next to the elevators, which are used all night long. when speaking to the front desk, i was told that they were simply honoring my request for an upper floor, which i had requested for a better view. i am looking at a brick wall, and getting no sleep. he also told me that they had received complaints before from guests on the 16th floor, and were aware of the noise problem. why then did they place us on this floor when the hotel is not totally booked? a request for an upper floor does not constitute placing someone on the top floor and using that request to justify this. if you decide to stay here, request a room on a lower floor and away from the elevator! i spoke at length when booking my two rooms about my preferences. this is simply poor treatment of a guest whom they believed would not complain.
deceptive	"during my recent stay at the hyatt regency chicago, i was severely disappointed in the quality of the facility and its staff. to start off, the rooms did not provide an adequate sound barrier between rooms. hoping to spend a quiet evening after a long day of business meetings, i had hoped to spend a quiet night in. my neighbors, however, watching what i can only imagine was a real house wives of new jersey marathon on full volume, destroyed my chance for peaceful ambiance. when i asked the concierge to address the issue, he seemed more concerned about his texting than doing his job. as i visited the gym, i found their ""state-of-the-art"" stayfittm gym consisted in nothing more than a couple of treadmills, weights and yoga mats. the water in the cooler was quite warm, and the workout towels were stained and tattered. finally, all the hypo-allergenic features touted on their website were rendered null by the presence of dust balls under the beds."
truthful	had a week long stay at the hilton on south michigan while attending a meeting. the hotel has some elegance in the lobby, meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating. i would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch. my car was misplaced during valet parking, our reservations were messed up, hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items (room service, a new coffee pot, laundry) that wasn't ours. i would not stay at this property again. there are much better places for the money in close proximity to michigan ave. it is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at faulty towers.
truthful	after reading some of the most recent reviews i'm really perplexed. i didn't know what to expect, but i was most pleasantly surprised. just as all the past reviews, both negative and positive, have stated, you can't beat the location of this hotel. it's perfect. we had a big spacious room in the old tower. we avoided the expensive pitfalls of the hotel extras such as bottled water and items in the room fridge. the beds were great, the rooms were kept clean and the staff was very friendly. great martinis in the hotel bar. i really can't understand the negative reviews. i know you can't please everyone, but in some cases i simply don't believe their claims. i've traveled a lot and have stayed in plenty of hotels. this is a great hotel!
deceptive	"the name conrad (the most luxurious of all hilton hotels) should illicit nothing but images of pure elegance and luxury; however, the conrad in chicago, il did obviously not receive the memo. upon entering the hotel, we were not greeted by any of the hotel staff. additionally, we were not offered any help. the desk receptionist was beyond rude. her snide remarks towards my wife and me set the tone for a the rest of our stay. after getting our card, we were finally offered help with our luggage. the young man who helped us could barely handle our luggage. strangely, he somehow found more strength when it was time to collect his tip. he received the tip he deserved, which he scoffed about and groaned under his breath as he walked away. upon first looking at the room it was beautiful. however, closer inspection revealed that the room had not been cleaned since the last visitor had left. there was hair in the sink and around the toilet. there was even a used bar of soap in the bathtub. this fact was not met with any apology by hotel staff. instead, i was told that was preposterous and that the room had indeed been cleaned to the highest of standards. two-hours later, someone came into the room to ""investigate"". when they saw the mess that had been left, they offered a menial apology. still another two hours later, housekeeping arrived. the level of incompetence even extended to the valets in the parking garage. in the most incredible display of stupidity of our visit, the valet actually brought the wrong car to me. i was half tempted to take the car that was brought to me (it was certainly an incredible make and model), but my better judgment prevailed. i informed the valet of his mistake, to which he replied, ""sorry dude, i read your ticket wrong."" i know that he did not smoke in my car, but he smelled so strongly of smoke, that the smell melted into my seat. luckily, its location on rush will help get out of the terror that is conrad chicago. there are so many better hotels in chicago -- please spend your money elsewhere."
truthful	"i recently returned from a trip to chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby. while the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers. when we arrived it took over an hour to check in. we had requested two rooms on the same floor, which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival. when we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it. eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there. we also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers. when we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in. we also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping. we filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests. after complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate. this ""something"" never arrived. we will not be making a return visit to this hotel. while the housekeeping staff, location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative."
truthful	i stayed at this hotel for 1 night. we just wanted to stay in downtown chicago. this hotel is right next to john hancock building. walking distance to many shopping, restaurant, and everything else. from valet people to front desk people, they were all very friendly and helpful. the best thing about this hotel (other than the awesome location) is that all rooms are suites. you can choose 1 king or 2 double which will be inside the room and you get another sofa bed in the living room area. you get 2 tvs also. the roof top pool over looking michigan lake was lovely also.
deceptive	i was visiting relatives in chicago and wanted to stay in a hotel that emphasized luxury and was also environmentally friendly, and the talbott seemed to fit the bill. i also couldn't help but notice all the positive reviews online. i figured i couldn't go wrong and i am happy to report the positive reviews are true. first of all check in was a breeze. i love their online reservation system. it was easy to use and the information presented was quick and accurate. once i arrived in chicago i was greeted by tim at the door and i immediately felt like wanted and liked. the receptionist was very polite and when she heard i was visiting chicago for the first time, she upgraded my deluxe king to an executive king. score! the room was just as advertised, luxurious and convenient. it was also exceptionally clean and this is very important to me because i am paranoid of germs and bed bugs. most importantly though, i got a good night's sleeep because the bed and pillows were super soft, but firm enough to help support my back. i also used the equinox fitness club and, wow, what a club. this is another great amenity of the talbott and easily beats other hotels skimpy workout centers. my check-out was quick, easy, and painless. this hotel gets my highest recommendation. the facilities are immaculate and modern with the recent upgrade, the staff is ultra-friendly and competent, and the location was perfect for my needs.
deceptive	the swissotel chicago hotel aspires to be a tourist's paradise, a hotel so grand and luxurious that you'd rather stay than return home at the end of your trip. but is it really as magnificent as suggested? true, you can get a massage, the rooms have flat screen t.v.s and ipod docks, heck, there's even a gym. but the truth is, you're really paying much more for a few things you don't really need. the swissotel attempts to lure you in with their illusions of grandeur, when really, all you're getting is a holiday inn style room with fancy wallpaper and the ability to play tunes from your mp3 player. overpriced dining options are available at the palm restaurant. they claim to serve excellent lobster, yet what i ordered was the size of a craw fish, and left the taste of a burnt fifty dollar bill in my mouth. this hotel hides behind a velvet curtain, hoping their facade won't be revealed.
truthful	dispite what other are saying, this was one, if not the best hotel stay in chicago i have had. i travel to the big city about three times a year for pleasure and the james rates up with the best. i was upgraded and the staff made the stay worth my special weekend visit. i don't believe you will be disapointed.
truthful	this small boutique hotel is tucked away in a perfect location between the loop and the miracle mile. two blocks west of the wrigley building and so convenient to restaurants, etc. the staff, from doormen to desk folks are extra nice and accommodating. the delicious breakfast on each floor is ultra-convenient, the evening happy hour is more than generous, and the morning paper is welcome. bedding is so comfortable. this is our second stay, and certainly not our last. we love chicago, and this hotel is one of the reasons why.
deceptive	me and my wife stayed at the omni hotel in chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital. we ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here. at first once coming into the room, there was a mildewy smell in the air, which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase. the continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well. the eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all. to make matters even worse, the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon, when my wife was back from exploring the city. this was simply unacceptable by any standard.
deceptive	"for all the hype and rave reviews of the talbott hotel, it seemed to me that it would be a mistake to not stay there, not the other way around. the talbott hotel website claims to have ""opulent accommodations, impeccable service, and unexpected delights."" the last time i checked, ""opulent"" had a bit of a different meaning than ""easily outdone by the senile 90-year-old landlord of your college apartment,"" ""impeccable"" wasn't code for ""rude and unfriendly,"" and ""unexpected delights"" were more fun than a faint but obvious stain on your sheets at a hotel. overall, my stay here simply wasn't worth the money or the hassle involved in making the correct reservations. for a lot less,i could have been treated rudely and had a mediocre stay in a more casual environment."
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel for two nights and i must say the service they rendered was quite impressive. they had very attentive and friendly staff members. the room that i stayed in was spacious for me and my husband. their hotel restaurant served the most delicious steaks i have tasted, i ordered a classic fillet mignon and it was cooked to perfection. i would definitely stay at this hotel again if ever i come back to chicago and would absolutely highly recommend this to my friends and family.
deceptive	my boyfriend and i wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown chicago and do all the touristy things; shop the magnificient mile, see shedd aquarium, go to the museum of science and industry. homewood suites was conveniently located near all of these things. it was a luxurious treat of a weekend! we even swam in their rooftop indoor pool. it was also nice to have the amenities of a suite, so we could prepare our own meals some days. the staff was friendly and courteous (they even gave me an extra pillow on request!) and we would definitely stay there again.
deceptive	my stay here was superb. the view from my windows was stunning, as i looked out i could see the beautiful grant park. the room had a nice airy feel but was also warm and inviting. the bed was very comfortable. the wireless internet was fast and effective which is nice especially when on business trips. the hotel is in walking distance to the museum which is nice for those on vaca. overall i thouroughly enjoyed my stay here.
deceptive	"i never thought i'd be able to stay at a hotel and feel completely at home. i am a mother of two children, one of which has severe asthma and allergies. i have spent more time in hospital emergency rooms than my own living room for the past two and a half years. so when my sister was getting married in chicago, i was extremely anxious. the front desk associate, rosa, was wonderful. she told me that they have allergy friendly rooms. no perfumes, no harsh cleaning chemicals, no dreaded ""industry standard"" feather pillows. i booked a room, but was still really worried. i shouldn't have been. ethan breathed as easily in that beautiful room as he did in our own home. maybe even a little better. they had an air purification system for our room. it smelled so fresh! while my husband took our daughter to the big bar for nachos (she never stopped talking about how ""totally cool"" it was), i ordered room service for my son. the man who answered the phone was so patient and accommodating. my son has a lot of food allergies, so i was pretty much ordering off menu with specific details. that's always a little humbling, but the staff treated my order with the grace as though they did special orders all the time. i was actually able to enjoy my sister's wedding. the only problem with my stay is that it was too short. we're coming back for our first family vacation since ethan was born. thank you, hyatt regency chicago, for making this family's visit possible and positive!!"
truthful	"as a frequent traveler to chicago, i generally stay at the sutton court, but thought i would try a different boutique hotel. i will never stay at this hotel again. the first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet, leaving me absolutely claustrophobic! actually the smallest hotel room i've been in in the u.s! i complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a ""premium"" room -- still quite small, but manageably so. the bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. the location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the el (elevated subway - background noise), and the street was pretty deserted on a sunday evening. i will say that the free wi-fi was great. if you can find a chain or other hotel closer to michigan avene, i'd highly recommend you take that. if you want a nice room in a great location, check out sutton place hotel instead."
truthful	excellent location, about a block from michigan ave. and two blocks from water tower place and john hancock tower. beautiful hotel, felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel. staff was excellent -- friendly and accommodating.
truthful	"we've just returned from a two night stay at the affinia chicago and our visit was delightful. thanks to tripadvisor reviews we were prepared for the major construction work on the facade and entrance..it was a mess. and the hotel restaurant and bar remain incomplete and unavailable. even parts of the lobby had ""wet paint"" stickers. all these things could have made for a disappointing stay. not so!! although we arrived very early in the day our suite was ready along with a most warm and gracious greeting from the front desk staff. after just a few minutes we felt like we were ""at home."" the suite on the 25th floor, with a fab view along a wall of windows, was sparkling fresh and clean. the bathroom lighting was outstanding and led to my bride of nearly 50 years saying that it made her look younger...she was right! everything in and about the room was ""like-new"" and very stylish. as a visitor we appreciated the very convenient location just a few steps from the magnificient mile and all of its ambiance. thanks to a dedicated and gracious staff, a fantastic location, and chic decorating elements, this hotel can and will be our future hotel of choice in chicago. the stay was short..but sweet."
truthful	good location and looks like a good property but did not seem to be managed well. front desk staff was inattentive to customers and slow. nice large suite for a room but plumbing fixtures were in disrepair (housekeeping staff could/should have reported each day) - partially clogged shower head, dripping sink, etc. clean and ok, but neglected - we expected more from an intercontinental hotel. many hotels to choose from in this area of chicago - can get more for the price from almost any other.
deceptive	this was the best choice my husband and i could have chosen to visit! the hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water! i was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym. everything was so clean and invoting. especially the pump room; there was so much history in one rooom. overall, we had a great, relaxing vacation away from the kids. i would definitely return to the ambassador next time we're in the area!
deceptive	excellent staff and customer service, very clean and spotless. elegant and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view. the bed is very comfortable and relaxing. i give it a five star.
deceptive	the conrad chicago is a michelin rated hotel, so i was expecting great service and wonderful accommodations. well, only one part of that was correct. the rooms are indeed nicely furnished, but the service was terrible! the concierge was unable to find my room reservation (i reserved online and even had the email confirmation) and wasn't very helpful in getting me a new room. i ordered room service, and the wait time was so long that the food came up cold. i mean, i understand that it would take time to get the food prepared and up to my room, but really? for the price i paid, it was definitely not worth it, and i would never use this hotel again.
deceptive	i went to stay at this hotel last year. i have got to say it was a great authentic experience, the dining restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff. its location couldn't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping. looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful. it is very affordable. i recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town.
deceptive	whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas. most notably is cleanliness, as although the lobby was very clean, the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not. dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways, and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time. the furnishings were nice and modern, but with various blemishes upon close inspection. bathroom was relatively clean, with the exception of the shower. view was nice for this particular room, and service was relatively quick. the food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue. this time with the glasses which were stained, the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel. i will not make the mistake of staying here again.
deceptive	while traveling in chicago i stayed at the sofitel on chestnut street. though the hotel was a beautiful and comfortable as the advertisements suggest; service was severely lacking. i arrived late at night and had one peaceful dreamy nights sleep before being woke up at dawn. i reserved a room on one of the lower floors unaware of the construction happening in the area. i complained that i had not been informed of the construction and requested another room. my complaint was totally disregarded. i was told there were no other rooms in the whole hotel available. when i explained that the noise was bothersome i was treated rudely. the woman at the front desk actually ask me if i thought she could make the workers stop. i understand that the staff has no control over the noise. they did however know about the construction. information i did not have at the time i booked. information that would have swayed my decision. then to treat me so rudely for bringing it to their attention. i will not be staying there again.
deceptive	we really enjoyed our stay! it is a beautiful hotel and the entire staff is helpful and polite. they had great suggestions on where to eat, what to do, etc. we were within walking distance of many great chicago locations like the navy pier and art institute. the rooms were clean and the beds comfortable, i would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great home away from home in chicago.
deceptive	"when i made my reservations at softiel in chicago, i was expecting the ultimate in luxury but softiel failed to deliver. everything was just ok. i do not spend money on a quality hotel for ""just ok"". if i want ""just ok"" i'll check into the days inn! first of all there were problems with our reservation. i asked to have a room near the top floors and my room was actually only on the fifth floor! the desk clerk was less than helpful to fix this. i eventually got it fixed but i certainly did not feel at all like a valued guest during this process. later when i went down to ask for directions and information at the desk the clerk was very cold and abrupt with us. the room was quite nice but the shower did not deliver adequate water pressure. on the second day of our stay, housekeeping did not refill our soaps or coffee. they also failed to empty one of our wastebaskets. minor i know, but when you're paying for a luxury experience, you kind of expect luxury! the hotel itself was nice but the staff really don't deliver. i would not stay here again. you can get a nice clean room at laquinta for 1/4 the price and the staff is much more helpful."
truthful	the hotel definitely doesn't match its 4.5 rating. the receptionist was very unhelpful and dishonest, and i don't feel welcome at all. i booked a non-smoking room, but upon arrival, the receptionist told me that there was no non-smoking room left. of course he was lying. i argued with him for 5 minutes, before he reluctantly gave me a non-smoking room. at checkout, they tried to charge me $40 upgrade fee each day, because i requested a non-smoking room. this was completely ridiculous. i had to go argue with the receptionist again before they agreed to take away the charges. the room was quite small, the tv was broken, so i had to call someone to fix the tv. then the wireless network banned my ip address, so i had to talk to their tech-support -- the tech support was quite friendly, knowledgeable and helpful -- i guess this was the only bright point of the stay.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the hyatt regency chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary. we could not have picked a better locate. the price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget. the flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine. my husband loved the stetson steakhouse and the 24 hour stay fit gym. we really did not leave the hotel during i stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away. if we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay. this hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and i. what a wonderful ten years celebration.
truthful	i stayed in this hotel during a business trip, and while conducting a business meeting in the hotel bar, a customer grabbed all of the cash out of my wallet. security was informed, but i was told that i had to wait to talk to them. after about twenty minutes of waiting i was informed that if i did not continue to wait l would never be able to report the incident, despite the fact that i was a hotel guest. unfortunately i had to go to a business dinner and could no longer wait. long story short, i no longer felt comfortable in this hotel and wish that someone, anyone would have talked to me about it. i've since been on the phone with a manager, who promised to call me back once she researched the incident, and have yet to hear back, despite the promise that she would call me back two days ago. i expected more from this hotel.
deceptive	the knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit. my wife and i utilized the park & play package, which gave us an amazing room, complimentary valet service, and a great kit to plan our weekend around. it was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again. the rooms were top notch and the hotel's staff was excellent. one of the employees, craig, helped us find our way around the city and this shows the knickerbocker really cares about its guests. we loved our visit and are sure you will too. a+
truthful	the affinia is virtually the perfect hotel for a visit to chicago. my wife and i stayed in an upgraded suite. very large room, that is modern and has all the little touches. the staff was extremely helpful and professional. the location is excellent. the price is a good value for what you get. we simply couldn't find anything to criticize. highly recommended!
deceptive	the amalfi hotel in chicago was by far one of the best experiences i've had. it definitely felt as comfortable as home with the all the luxuriance of a five star establishment. i had forgotten my favorite cd that puts me to sleep each night. when mentioning this in front of the front desk clerk, she told me that they have a huge collection of cd's available for guests. low and behold, they had my favorite cd!! also, my laptop was not cooperating. come to find out, they offer every guest full access to their amazing and fully functional business center! from now on, when visiting chicago, i will only be staying at the amalfi hotel!
deceptive	"i first walk into the beautifully decorated lobby of the affinia chicago hotel where i'm greeted by name by the concierge. he tells me that they have taken the liberty of customizing the room to my profile from when i booked the stay. he shows me to my room (paying careful attention to my bags, and ensuring that i needn't lift a finger) sure enough, the down pillow i had selcted from the dream pillow menu sits proudly atop the queen of the domain, which by the way is covered with the softest of bedspreads making me wonder if they didn't literally drag a cloud in here and fit it on my bed. i notice that there's a display of champagne and cupcakes (!) atop the dresser and my ""experience kit"" which comes complete with an ipod shuffle downloaded with only my favorite workout tracks, and a yoga mat. namaste. unable to resist the urge to inspect the bathroom, i find that not only is there a marble tiled invisible glass shower, but a jacuzzi, lined with candles of vanilla, deep enough to bathe a walrus. feeling girlish, i run the water and test before going to dinner. the hotel's restraunt c-house offers the most delicious seafood menu that makes you think you're dining with the kings of paradise. or at least eating in the caribbean itself. hmm, i should have brought a date."
truthful	"i am not much of a complainer, as you can see when reviewing my other posts on this site, but the talbott provided such bad service that i feel the need to warn future travelers to chicago: my girlfriend and i stayed at the talbott for 2 nights in late july 2006. the first sign that something was wrong come during the initial booking of the room over the phone. the receptionist was outright rude, but took the reservation without a mistake. during our stay the hotel and restaurant staff was extraordinary incompetent, the waiters, the managers, nobody was friendly, nor tied to accommodate us. [------------------------] we and many others who stayed at the hotel attended a wedding reception close by and had arranged the hotel bar to remain open from 12-2 to have an after hour's party. the hotel manager had assured us that this was secured and done in the past upon such occasions. when we returned from the reception at 11:50pm the bar was closing and the night manager and hotel staff were very rude to me and my friends. ""nobody told us, we can't do anything for you."" ""are you sure that you arranged this?"" two quotes so typical for this hotel's staff that i know that i will never stay at this hotel again. i understand that mistakes are made and that communication can be difficult across different shifts in a hotel, but blaming the customer so being confused and failing to arrange what i know had been arranged for and was later confirmed by the day staff is too rude even for my taste.[-----]"
truthful	"we spent a week in this hotel and were very pleased with the experience. as described in previous reviews. the room was very comfortable with the huge televison and bathroom being particularly outstanding. service was excellent overall (i especially liked the bottle of water at my bedside with the turn down service). the door and bellmen/women were particularly pleasant and helpful and the concierge was friendly and knowledgeable. we had completely satisfactory (though overpriced) drinks in the bar but didn't eat at the restaurant. the health club was fine and the equipment was well maintained. while there were only three treadmills and two elipitical steppers, i never had to wait for a machine although it might be a different story in the dead of a chicago winter! one minor quibble--i like to have coffee first thing in the morning and there was no in-room coffee maker. the restaurant offered free coffee ""to-go"" but only before eight am. this is a very, very comfortable, attractive hotel in a wonderful location. chicago is an expensive city but we felt that we got a reasonable value for our money."
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel, and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that i ever had. one of the main reasons why i had originally booked my stay at the fairmont was because the property offered special, ""pure"" rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic. because i suffer from extreme allergies -- and i really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- i was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities. i'll tell you this right now -- save your money. when i got to my room, i immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold. to add to the gross factor, i took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet. the comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it. there was no way i was going to stay in this room, so i made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room. the woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer. after making me wait for another twenty minutes, she finally informed me that they could put me in another room, but it would be a four hour wait. four hours! it was absolutely ridiculous. no hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way. i do not recommend the fairmont nor will i ever stay there again."
truthful	location, location, location. what a great find! excellent, well-run, small boutique-type hotel on a tree-lined street near all the action without being in the oppressive crunch of it. rooms are good-sized and clean; good bed and shower with tub. the air conditioner, as mentioned in other reviews, is noisy, but it's a minor complaint. the staff is simply wonderful and attentive from housecleaning to concierge. the on site restaurant is great. the red-line el is about 3-4 blocks away which makes getting around the city a breeze. you are footsteps away from rush street and north michigan avenue and lake michigan. i would not have a moment's hesitation booking at this hotel again in the future; in fact, i wouldn't book anywhere else.
deceptive	the ambassador east is a particularly crappy property, given the numerous quality hotels in and around the gold coast. unfortunately, i saw an amazing rate and decided to book -- this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for. while the lobby was gorgeous (and appears to match the photos on the website) the room i was assigned was run down, and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website. it looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls, but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty. the room also smelled of must or mildew. while the room did have air-conditioning as advertised, it was an in-window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg. i was only here for a single night, but had i been here for anywhere longer i would have requested a refund. please, if you're staying in this part of town, do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here. the hampton inn and hilton garden inn are both nearby, clean, and often have special-offers -- these aren't the only properties in the area, but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay.
truthful	"this is my letter to the management..... sir or madam: i am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the amalfi. we were a guest from 11/20 to 11/23. during our stay we used the ""valet"" service operated through standard parking. our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments. much to my chagrin, $44/day valet service did not include proper security/monitoring, despite the premium over ""self park"". i understand that these parking services are sub-contracted by the hotel, but i would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation. this was not the case. i hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests"
deceptive	"stay away from this hotel. a few months back me and my wife decided to get out and have a nice pampered away from home weekend. looking at different options for this weekend we decided to go with the sheraton chicago hotel and towers. they claim "" experience the extraordinary "" and this sounded great. when we arrived at hotel we were met buy a closed front door and nobody to help with bags. the front desk clerk explained that our room was not yet ready and to goto the bar for some complemenatry drinks. after waiting 2 hours for our room we finally can start to relax. well upon entering room the smell of something horrible is overwhelming . the front desk informed us there was no other rooms and they would bring up some air freshner. we packed our bags and headed over to ""x"" hotel and were able to get to our pampered weekend away from home."
deceptive	my husband and i arrived for a 3 night stay for our 10th wedding anniversary. we had booked an executive guest room, upon arrival we were informed that they would be upgrading us to a beautiful junior suite. this was just a wonderful unexpected plus to our beautifully planned weekend. the front desk manager was professional and made us feel warmly welcomed. the chicago affinia was just a gorgeous hotel, friendly staff, lovely food and great atmosphere. not the mention the feather pillows and bedding that was just fantastic. also we were allowed to bring out beloved shi-tzu and he experienced the jet set pets stay. the grooming was perfect, the daycare service we felt completely comfortable with. this was a beautiful weekend, thank you affinia hotels! we would visit this hotel again!
truthful	my husband and i stayed here for three nights while visiting chicago as tourists. what a beautiful hotel! our room was lovely, the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient. they don't have an in house gym, but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street. the restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast. the concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there. we were able to walk down the magnificent mile from our hotel, as well as through the gold coast and old towne neighborhoods. there are tons of great restaurants in the area (including the famous gibsons and the signature room in the hancock tower) as well as lots of shopping. there is currently a lot of construction going on near the talbott (they are building condos right behind it), but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting chicago.
deceptive	the amalfi hotel in chicago advertises itself as family friendly, yet when i arrived with my children it was anything but family friendly. the staff seemed miffed and stuck up, and i had to wait for the personal check in. i was too worried that my kids would ruin the obviously really expensive furniture while i waited, and other guests (all single or couples without children) seemed annoyed every time i passed with my kids while i was trying to keep them entertained before we checked in. this might not be the best place to stay if you have a kid or two, even though it is advertised as such. i give you a great big thumbs down for false advertising, amalfi.
truthful	"i just returned from a 2 night stay at the hotel. i had requested a high floor, quiet room. neither request was honored. the windows are not well insulated, because the traffic, car horns and sirens continued all night long. on the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway. the safe in our room did not work. someone had locked it before our arrival. one of the pictures under the tv had been removed, leaving a screw sticking out of the wall. the lights are so dim, that is next to impossible to read. a small alcove with a stained bench had a ""reading light"" that was about 50 watts. our room key cards didn't work, so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them. upon returning to our room, they didn't work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff. the bathroom is small and has no fan, so the steam covers the mirrors, and unless you leave the bathroom door open, it does not clear. on friday night one small cookie was left in our room. what about a second guest. are we supposed to split a 2 inch diameter cookie???!!!! on sunday the phone rang with a 7 am wakeup call. we had not requested to be woken up!!!! the concierge did not know the way to get to o'hare by train, and gave us a longer route than was necessary. i have stayed in much better hotels in chicago...quieter and more spacious, more elegant and worth the money. this is definitely not worth $400 a month. (by the way, i live in washington, dc and am used to city noise. this was unacceptable!)"
truthful	we recently stayed at the intercontinental hotel for a week. the hotel was in a wonderful location and the service was great. we found all of the staff very helpful and prompt. we highly recommend the intercontinental for any travel needs whether it be for business or pleasure.
truthful	i stayed at palmer house for one night in early january this year. during the check in, the front desk lady asked me to show my confirmation letter of my reservation. i did not bring the confirmation with me because i had not been asked to present it in other places during check in.so she asked to print out one copy in their business center and bring the confirmation to the bell station to get the room key. i did what she told me and went to the bell station. however, people at the bell station was totally confused and none of them have the key. a bellman was nice enough to help me go ask their staff at the front desk. i finally got checked in after waiting at the lobby for about 15 minutes. as other people pointed out before, the room i got was small and old with a twin bed, and i could hear people next door using the bathroom. this was not a pleasant experience, even though i paid over 100 dollars to the hotel.
truthful	my daughter and i woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. when we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. i then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. both were out of service!!!! i am glad there wasn't an emergency. as we were exited the pool area i ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
truthful	this hotel was great - in a great area right downtown and close to everything. the daily happy hour had great food, wine and premium liquors. the free breakfast was even better! actually i believe everything was included breakfast/happy hour/business center/wifi. our room was a king size facing the back of the building. really clean new and comfortable. small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel - would highly recommend.
truthful	stayed at the fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on tripadvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel. good location but the room was dirty, and not just from the last housekeeping. it was dingy: a place where you needed the slippers they provided. and this was a suite. also, the refrigerator was caked with ice and didn't work. furthermore, because my travel agent had mixed up the dates i was to travel, i showed up a day late. the hotel said it wasn't a problem and that i wouldn't be charged for the no-show the night before. i had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day. then the fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve. neither i nor my corporate travel desk will use the fitzpatrick again. two dots only because it's in a good location and because the lobby was clean. i'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad.
deceptive	the affinia chicago is a wonderful place to stay, my husband and i stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time. the rooms were very well organized and comfortable, the staff there are very friendly, and the food there is more then amazing. we are defiantly going back next year.
truthful	i have traveled to chicago many times for business, and so i have expectations of hotels based on reasonable comparisons. there was nothing dramatically wrong the sheraton, but it was simply overpriced for the quality of the hotel. it almost looked as if an accountant walk through the hotel looking for places to cut costs. the carpets were old, there was only one bar of soap in the bathroom, towels and linens were older than i expected, the rooms were in need of some redecorating, etc. during the week i was paying $349 per night for a room, and it simply was not near the quality i expected for that price. one positive to notice that the fitness room was quite good. plenty of aerobic machines with tvs, weights, etc. location is also quite good (perhaps the reason for the high price) with close walks to michigan avenue and the river. in summary, i think you can find a much nicer hotel in a much better price in downtown chicago.
deceptive	my family and i recently attended a wedding in chicago and stayed at the swissotel. it was much nicer than we expected. we are used to staying at mid-class hotels and this, by far, was one of the nicest places we've stayed. the beds were so comfortable and the crib the provided for my infant son was great quality - i was concerned that we would get a rickety 1970s crib! the bed sheets were so soft that i wanted to take them home! we will definitely go back to this hotel the next time we are in chicago.
truthful	my stay at the the james was perfect. my room was thoughtfully designed: the lighting, the storage space, the bar area, the eating nook and everything else in the room was purposeful and pretty to look at. the staff was friendly and and genuinely accomadating. the restaurant (primehouse) echoed the above. great service and one of the best steaks i've had in a very long time.
deceptive	the amalfi hotel has become my absolute favorite place to stay when i visit chicago. this place really knows how to treat their guests. they serve a complimentary breakfast on every floor and even have ipod docking stations in the room! if you want to watch a movie you can just borrow it from their collection. i took advantage of the free wi-fi and the plush bathrobes. while i stayed there i had to try the spa services that were offered. wonderful experience! the staff really made me feel comfortable during my stay and i will definitely be staying there again on my next trip to chicago.
deceptive	our experience at hotel monaco was wonderful. my fiancee and i stayed two nights in the tranquility suite--absolutely exquisite! we had wonderful room service and practically never had to leave our room. (except to go to the gym :) i was able to do yoga on the trip because they had yoga accessories in the room! i was surprised by that. this hotel was the definition of 'luxury', they had anything we needed and more. my fiancee said we were staying at a really 'nice' hotel but i had no idea until we walked in the door. as soon as you walk in you are met with the charming atmosphere and luxurious decor. i have to admit, cheesy as it may sound, i felt like a queen all weekend long :) most of the time i have at least one problem with the hotel i stayed at, but i have to say at this point i have no complaints at all about hotel monaco and i will definitely look forward to staying there again during my next trip to chicago.
deceptive	"after staying at the omni chicago hotel recently, i was nothing but disappointed. this ""luxury hotel"" obviously spends too much money on their marketing to convince people how luxurious they are and not enough on actually making their hotel comfortable. when i arrived, my hotel room was devoid of towels, and after calling down to the front desk, it took three hours and two more calls to finally get some fresh towels delivered. on top of that, when i went to connect to the internet in my room, the wifi signal was too weak and i was forced to go out into the hall to connect with my laptop! for the exorbitant price they charged me for one night in their ""superior corner suite"", i could have stayed a week at a holiday inn, and after this stay, i wish i had."
truthful	i booked this hotel on priceline for 4/13, and a week later called the hotel directly to add 4/12 to our stay. the receptionist confirmed my reservation confirmation# and gave me a lower rate for both nights for the same king suite. when we arrived at check-in, there was no record of my 4/12 reservation whatsoever. the hotel was also fully booked, leaving my tired, hungry family and i high and dry with nowhere to go. the only decent thing that happened with this whole debacle was that lisa at the check-in desk called around to several other hotels close-by to find us a room, and seemed to be the only employee working at a very busy time of evening. we ended up at embassy suites for both nights and had a very pleasant experience there.
deceptive	let me just preface this by saying that i absolutely loved my stay at this hotel. i chose it largely for location as i don't really love to walk that much and i was incredibly pleased with its situation in the city. it was just a couple blocks away from several museums and shopping districts but my husband and i mainly ventured out for food, of which there were great options and the concierge was a great help. we had originally booked the king guestroom but upon arrival were upgraded to the deluxe king guestroom by the front desk. everyone was remarkably friendly and helpful which is something i look for and remember when i go to stay in a location again. our room was amazing. seriously amazing. it was so chic and i just loved the headboard over our bed. there wasn't one little spot of dust to be found. the bathroom was gorgeous and we made full use of the two bathrobes in the closet. we didn't take anything from the snack bar but it all looked delicious. we had dinner at david burke's primehouse. i cannot recommend the ny ribeye more highly. it was fantastic. for dessert we had the brown butter corn cake. i've been trying to replicate that dish ever since i got home. i'm sad to say that i didn't get a chance to try any of the treatments at spa by asha but i definitely will make a point to on my return visit. the james chicago made our trip to chicago memorable. the staff was friendly, the hotel beautiful, and the food delicious. what more could you want?
truthful	warning: food poisoning alert!!! the room was dirty, the shower had mold and the handle in the shower my daughter cracked her head open on. the elevators were absolutly terrible they made me dizzy every time i went on it. they hade pasta night and they put out a bowl of noodles and sauce and i couple of rolls well you get what you pay for. what was worse is the sauce must of had bad meat in it because my family got so sick. the one thing that was nice was the location which was right by michigan avenue. the second night we left and went to another hotel which was 80 bucks cheaper and 100 times nicer. do not stay here
deceptive	"my husband and i decided to plan a romantic get-away for our one year anniversary when we stumbled upon the talbott hotel in chicago. we decided to book the ""personally yours romance package"" for our stay. when we arrived at the hotel, the staff was very friendly and approachable. the personalized key cards we received upon check-in were a wonderful touch. each night, we would return to our suite to find the linens turned down and rose petals scattered across the bed. the personal concierge even helped me plan a special outing for my husband and i to see a chicago cubs baseball game. i would recommend this hotel to anyone planning a weekend away."
truthful	my stay at the ambassador east was great! the hotel is in a great location in the charming gold coast neighborhood of downtown chicago. gave me the feeling of staying in a chicago neighborhood vs. the concrete jungle of downtown, but the magnificent mile and rush street are just a few blocks from the front door. the staff was very friendly. also, really enjoyed having drinks in the historic pump room. they had a live band on saturday, and i really enjoyed looking at the pictures of the celebrities throughout the lounge that visited from years gone by. definitely recommend it.
deceptive	how should i start? well, after staying at the ambassador east hotel, i realized it was my favorite hotel ever. the rooms are amazing. the food is great. the pump room bar is awesome. i love this hotel. if your ever in chicago, the ambassador east hotel is the place to go.
deceptive	i was sorely disappointed with the sheraton chicago. from the outside it looks like a great hotel, and i guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy, not what i expected when looked at the website. the front desk staff was nice enough at first, but when i asked for the wifi password they told me i had to pay extra. i mean come on, i'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is extra? the lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation. (note to self, don't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd.) so things started off on the wrong foot anyhow. i guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview (from some of the rooms) and it seems pretty safe. other than that i was not impressed for the price - i've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens, a better restaurant, where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour (we stayed two nights and we didn't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5). i guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell. in general it seems lke it's on the decline and the staff knows it, they're just kind of lackadaisical. i wouldn't stay there again.
truthful	a bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance. will definitely stay here again
deceptive	the ambassador east hotel is a terrible place to stay. all of the rooms are old and dirty as though they haven't been cleaned or remodeled for years. the hotel staff is not friendly or accomodating. do not waste your money in this crappy old hotel full of rude employees.
deceptive	my husband and i went to chicago for three nights for a quick get-away. we chose fairmont chicago millennium park because it was located at the heart of the city, downtown chicago. the hotel itself was very elegant and modern. the bed was extremely comfortable and i was able to wake up with music from my ipod. i would definitely stay with them again.
deceptive	we were amazed by this hotel. the first great part is the location. its so close to some of the great shopping the city has to offer. the view from the terrace suite at night was breathtaking looking over chicago. they even had a florist, as i bought my wife a rose. the menus, the lobby, everything was fantastic. the room was clean when we arrived as it was every time we came back to it each day. i didn't use the fitness center but it looked very nice, i did however visit the bar....and when i return to chicago, i will again.
truthful	"i selected the talbott after 3 hrs comparing hotels online. we have had wonderful experiences with boutiques (monaco, allegro) and assumed this would be comparable. good points: the lobby is beautiful, and one staff member took roses i bought for my wife and arranged them nicely. the many problems: when my wife called with a question on our arrival day, the agent could find no reservation -- 15 mins later she was transferred to another person who found the record instantly. when we arrived, the lobby was stuffed with students; nobody tried to manage the group, several of whom pushed ahead to the check-in desk. we left our bags and went out for 2 hrs so we could check in with less hassle. we finally were checked in, after waiting 15 mins while the confused desk clerk searched for rooms. when we got there, our room had not been made up from the last guest. when we complained, we were given an ""upgrade"" to a room that was old and uninspired. chairs are scuffed, closet shelves are bowed, the air conditioner is noisy, and a wall lamp is loose. the view is of a construction site. movies-on-demand are dated. we expect this from a budget hotel, not one positioning itself as elegant and upscale. when we returned after an evening out, the card reader to open the main doors did not work. one staff member admonished us (really) for not using the reader, when in fact we had tried. this was embarrassing, as others were standing in the lobby. i tried to access the hotel's wifi network, but was only given a $9.95 upgrade option. i called the desk, and was told to ""click past it"", which of course did nothing. it wasn't until 2 hrs later the complimentary access worked. we are pretty easygoing; we love good treatment and tip handsomely. if we had only 1or 2 problems, we wouldn't write. in fact, we would not have written except the hotel did not make things right. the president wrote a letter, and suggested others at the hotel would be in touch...nobody ever was."
truthful	we booked our room at the swissotel on hotwire for $88 (unbelievable rate!) and were extremely impressed with the swissotel. the staff was so polite and catered to our every need. the room was oversized, clean, and had a large bathroom. we had a partial view of lake michigan, which was an added bonus. on the 42nd floor, they have a spotless workout room and pool with a view of the city and lake from 3 sides. spectacular! we sat in the hot tub and looked down on navy pier. we can't wait to go to the swissotel again!
truthful	this hotel is the perfect location for downtown chicago shopping. the only thing is the pool is extremely small - it is indoors, but looks much larger on the website.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the conrad chicago on our 1st anniversary tripped and had a wonderful experience thanks to the staff. not only is the hotel and a great location with many places to eat and socialize within walking distance, but they rooms were also clean and quiet. the staff was helpful and accommodated our requests. we'll definitely be staying here again next time we visit chicago! also if you stay you must eat at the restaurant. fabulous food!
deceptive	our stay at the sofitel was definitely below our expectations. the staff was less than nice to me after i waited several minutes until i was noticed. at first, my reservation could not be found, so i was provided a spare room. the hotel was fairly neat. however, once we got to the room, and onto the bed, we found the bed to be noisy. just sitting on it made a squeaking noise that was unpleasant. we immediately called down to the front desk and informed them of our concern. we were told to go back downstairs to settle things out. once we got downstairs, we were provided with another room number. however, we had to wait half an hour for another room to be cleaned and prepared. for such a well reviewed hotel, i was highly disappointed with the amount of time i had to spend to get settled into a room.
truthful	just returned from a week in chicago with the family. this hotel was perfect for us. location is great, kids loved the pool as a place to wind down after a day of museums, touring, ball games, etc. we checked in through hilton honors desk as opposed to the regular check in line. even though our reservations were through priceline at a reduced rate, they gave us a pick of the the rooms. the room had a large closet which helped with the amount of gear we had with us. used valet parking which was hasselfree. we had a great experience and would stay there again.
deceptive	worst high priced hotel i've ever stayed at! i had a business meeting in chicago and heard good reviews from a few co-workers thought it would be a nice place to stay but was a little upset with my experience with swissotel in chicago.front desk clerk was very rude at check in, valet parking was great until they brought my suv around front with a quarter size dent in the passenger size door, the hotel refused to pay for the damages. the room was very beautiful besides the faint mildew smell in the room. room service was great and very pleasing!our business meeting took place in the st gallen room where our meeting took a little disruptive turn, there was construction going on during that time and was very hard to hear the announcer in our meeting. other than that the hotel was beautiful but the stay wasn't as great as i expected, you may want to book somewhere else if you have a business meeting to attend in chicago.
deceptive	i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in chicago for 3 nights. i must say, i was not impressed. this is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill. to start with, the hotel lobby was totally gaudy. it had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and i guess was supposed to give an air of style. the room was ok i suppose, but certainly not worth the premium price i paid for it. the hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing french cuisine, but the food, while arranged nicely, tasted unremarkable and again, was overpriced. my final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible. it is simply not worth it.
truthful	"i would not recommend staying at the swissotel in chicago. i was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times. she had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since i would be arriving first. the ""night manager"" at the hotel was extremely rude and told me i could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation. (this was their mistake) they told me i could sit in the lobby for 4 hours until my friend arrived. they did nothing to try and help me until i stood there and complained for twenty minutes. i can't believe that a ""manager"" would treat a customer this way. there are other great hotels in chicago. this hotel is not worth the aggravation!"
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the amalfi chicago with my wife on a business trip. we decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded. we enjoyed the luxurious in-room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city. the individualized attention from check-in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service. the amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more. our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site. the hotel's design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses. lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable. breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt. being of european descent, i enjoyed the croissants, whole grain muffins, real butter and marmalade. we also brought along our standard poodle, sterling, and the amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family. we purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings. sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling ""at home"" while away. for pet lovers this is a big plus. finally, transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal. this allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this, another appreciated bonus of our stay. thank you amalfi for a superb experience."
deceptive	"i stayed at the ambassador east hotel this past summer for 5 days and it was the worst hotel experience i have ever had! firstly, the sheets that were on the bed seemed as if they were the same ones the previous guests had left on there; they looked dingy or just plain dirty. second, i went to function one night and came back in late so i was really tired the next morning, hence i slept in late. i put the ""do not disturb"" sign on my door and the room service still came knocking down my door asking if they can come and clean. obviously, the room service lady can't read. third, and worst of them all, when i checked i was only allowed valet parking so i gave up my keys hoping to get back my car in one piece. well, the next morning when i asked for my car to be retrieved, there was a big dent in the driver's door of my 2010 mustang! i was livid and the valet guy was insisting that he got it like that. in the end i had to get my door repaired on my own! the only thing i liked there was the food and it wasn't even all that. i was so disappointed and so i'm warning everyone to think twice before you make a reservation."
deceptive	i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker for 3 nights while on a business trip, as it was conveniently located a few blocks away from the office i was visiting, and just about everything else for that matter. the lobby was absolutely beautiful, and the staff was beyond courteous and extremely helpful. the rooms were elegant and spacious, and i instantly felt right at home. the large flat screen tv as a nice touch and tv options were many. i headed downstairs to the bar for a drink, and was amazed at how well kept it was, as well as how nice everybody was. as this was my first time i asked the bartender about the area around and he gave me great advice about some places to check out. all in all this was a great experience, and next time i'm in the area, i will definitely be staying here. i'd recommend the millennium knickerbocker to anyone traveling to chicago.
truthful	here are some pros and cons: pros: -good location -nice staff -clean room cons: -lack of bathroom amenities (i get better items at a holiday inn) -housekeeping wasn't so great... 1. a bathroom rug was taken out of my room (no idea why) and never returned it. the marble floor in the bathroom was very dangerous when slippery...i had to throw towels on the ground to make sure i did not fall. 2. i was charged for items i did not take out of the minibar.
truthful	"we stayed at the swissotel for a three day weekend, and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived. is it just me, or is this information not clearly stated on their website? a giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming. the room itself was fine. more bland and generic than the ""european elegance"" claimed on their website. the lack of hot water, was definitely not fine though. there were a couple pluses to our stay at swissotel. the location is good, the bed was comfortable and the room was clean. these few good points certainly did not redeem our experience, and i wouldn't pick this place again, even post-construction."
deceptive	i had high hopes for the ambassador east hotel, i really did. it seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access. i arrived to the hotel on a tuesday afternoon. i was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in. i could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck, doing nothing. as i walked in, nobody greeted me, and nobody offered to take my bags. the hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated, with a fine covering of dust. i went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys, all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer. i got to my room, and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking, there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway. having paid extra for an upgraded room, i was extremely disappointed by the condition inside. the drinking glasses were filthy, the towels smelled of mold, and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can. the television was a basic crt that looked to be about fifteen years old, and there was no channel guide, though i suppose i didn't need one for the six channels that it had. i had heard good things about the food at the ambassador east hotel, but alas, there was no respite here. the room service that i ordered took forty minutes to arrive, and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done. elsewhere in the hotel things were no better. everywhere i went, from the pool to the bar, the staff was hasty, rude, and completely uninterested, and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated. i really wanted to like the ambassador east hotel, but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out.
deceptive	"the ambassador east hotel is a business that certainly strives to keep its customers satisfied. upon my entrance at the ambassador east, i was greeted warmly. the staff was incredibly pleasant, and the accommodations were top-knotch. the food served at the award-winning ""pump room"" was to die for, and the service was fast but friendly."
truthful	this is a great hotel but there is no way that i would recommend it until the construction around it is complete. the elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5:30am and goes on into the night. dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 24/7. worst of all, the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating. ugh!
truthful	negative points: 1. i guess they gave me the worst room. it's small room with a king size bed even though i'd requested a room with two queen beds. 2. no roll away bed was available so i had to sleep on the floor. 3. the tub in the bathroom would not drain. 4. no exhaust fan in the bathroom. 5. broken furniture. plus point: 1. convenient location.
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago hotel is one of the finest hotels i have stayed at in a long time. the atmosphere upon arrival was one of elegance and beauty. the staff welcomed us and catered to our every need. the rooms were plush and very romantic. interior decor was breathtaking. it is definitely above a 4 star rating and i would not think twice about coming back here. it received my highest recommendation.
truthful	my wife and i stayed here in the middle of february 2005. we took the (el) subway to the hotel from o'hare. it was very convenient. the lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable. i've stayed in many a hotel room, this bed was the most comfortable i've ever slept in. the hotel is located in a great area and close to everything. walking distance to almost all the interesting sites chicago has. would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city.
truthful	"we got an awesome deal through priceline for a friday - sunday stay at $75 for each night. the hotel is very centrally located on michigan avenue ""the magnificent mile"". you can walk to a ton of shops & there are plenty of restaurants handy as well. the hotel staff was very friendly, and the room itself was gorgeous. very modern decor. not drab & typical like most other chain hotels. if staying in chicago we definitely will be staying there again. price for valet parking overnight was insane ($42/day), but what do you expect in a big city."
deceptive	after arriving at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel i was greeted with rudeness and snubery. my room reservations had been double booked, and instead of the suite i expected, i was given a much smaller guest room. instead of having a concierge i had cockroaches. the dining left me wishing for fast food. the bar left a bad taste in my mouth with the cheap liquor and hot beer.
deceptive	very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view. the dinning selection is one of the best i have seen in chicago. i have stayed many places downtown chicago and nothing matches this. i am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well. the shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors. the biggest thing that i have to say is that the customer service was great with everything that i needed. i give the hotel a 5 out of 5.
truthful	if i didn't have to stay here, i wouldn't. without exception, i swear i am not lying, every day of my stay brings a new problem. over the past 3 months, i have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time; problems every time. from the wrong food with room service, to room keys that dont work, unrefreshed bath towels, forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service, unclean ice bucket overnight, forgotten room cleaning, inability to connect to the internet....i'm too tired to keep writing all the problems. for the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel, i expect more. finally, their team is certainly not trained in customer service. the front desk teams have attitudes, and aria's hostesses think they are something else. i'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to aon, but i would never go back if i had a choice. the only good thing is the food at aria - outstanding.
deceptive	i am often traveling on business and i always try to stay at the james. the modern design of the lobby and restaurant with wood and glass creates a luxurious atmosphere and the streamlined, comfortable room design give an upscale aesthetic like that of a penthouse loft apartment. the availability of computers and coffee in the james' business centers means i do not have to lug my laptop around the hotel. the james provides the perfect setting for business travelers and is a cozy place to retire to in the evenings. the ease of breakfast service in the rooms means that i do not have to stress or rush, as my time is valuable. i love the james.
deceptive	do not stay at this hotel! a friend and i booked a 3-night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in chicago. though it was a bit pricy, we decided on the knickerbocker because it was in a great location, and the rooms looked large and well-kept. our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time. however, despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay, when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an hour until we were allowed up to our room. the concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us, and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late. to top it off, the maid service was terrible. the only thing they seemed to do was make the bed; no vacuuming, no fresh towels, etc. we didn't want to stay the third night, but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee. this hotel is way too much money for the services they provide, you'd be better off staying in a motel 6.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the swissotel chicago with my husband and two children. while the room was comfortable, i did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children. the main reason for this was the dining. while the in house restaurants had children's options, there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal. anyone with children knows that you don't want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times. this was especially true since we were traveling. we arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed. however, our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants. this was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package.
deceptive	the chicago palmer house disappointed me. i chose it because it a hilton hotel, but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name. my first impression was a negative one when i was greeted by a rather rude staff. my room might have been luxurious years ago, but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening. the bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible. the food served by the room service and at the hotel's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus, and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine. the food simply did not deliver its promises. everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small. the location of the hotel might seem like an advantage, since it is in downtown chicago nearby many touristic attractions: however, the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by. overall, this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the hilton name and price range.
truthful	"upon first entering the hotel, we were greeted by the most friendly and helpful bellmen i have ever encountered. through our 2 week stay, they told us to ""have a nice day"" as we left in the am and welcomed us back upon our return. breakfast is served in the am, and the servers were as delightful as the bellmen. it was a very enjoyable stay."
deceptive	on a recent business trip to chicago, i had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel. upon entrance, the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice. however, as i approached the check in counter, the woman working there was very terse and rude to me. they had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when i asked about changing it, i was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me. after a half hour, i finally received the correct room. the linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality, they were scratchy and had a musty smell. also, the bathroom wasn't cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket (including a condom) and there was no shampoo. also, i had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee. when i called the front desk to ask for some, they told be it was not free and would i like to charge the coffee to my account. i found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there.
truthful	the location of this hotel is excellent. the hotel itself is not a 4 star like they say - in my opinion. the room decor is horrible (probably more european than i am used to) and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment. on the upside, if you want to stay in a great location, feel safe, and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work. i prefer westin or marriott...something that you can count on.
deceptive	the talbott hotel claims to be chicago's premiere small luxury hotel. after staying there and experiencing the service, environment, and the hotel in general, i can say with confidence that this just isn't true. i arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and i was immediately disappointed. no one came to my car to collect my bags and i was forced to lug them inside myself. the doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me, leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags. once inside, the atmosphere was not what i expected. the lighting was poor, leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building. the carpet looked dirty, as if it hadn't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time, and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage. when i arrived at the front desk, i was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me. after checking in i went up to my room and was once again disappointed. the bed was very uncomfortable and i ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water. that night i ordered room service. the food took 45 minutes to get to my room, and when it finally arrived it was cold. the fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them. i would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends, and probably not to my enemies either. stay away!
truthful	just spent three nights at the amalfi hotel, while in chicago on business. booked a king-corner room and loved it. largest room i've ever had in a hotel in chicago, incredibly comfortable, very clean. the breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too. and the location couldn't be beat. walking distance to the the river, the loop, michigan ave shopping and convenient to public transportation. i noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise; yes there is some street noise, and the building across the street is under construction (the noise from that was usually between 730-4, if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side) but really, in downtown chicago it's not going to be silent, if you want silence stay in the suburbs. if you want a great hotel (at a great price) right in the thick of everything, stay at the amalfi.
truthful	"we stayed 6 pleasent days in this not too big and very friendly hotel. the rooms were spotless comfortable and great view too... also nice view from the roof-bar. the area is pleasant nice and clean, minute walk to magnificant mile, easy to walk around to the lake. friendly stuff, very clean, great warm hotel to stay in. it does not have the ""big hotel"" factory-like feeling - more like home :)"
deceptive	we stayed at this hotel for our last vacation to the windy city. although the hotel looks nice, the service is terrible. the staff was rude and unprofessional and not helpful at all. the room service closes at 8pm so don't plan on getting hungry after that time. also, even though we stayed for a whole week we had to ask for new towels and extra toiletries. i will never go back to that place
truthful	i stayed at the hotel one night. the hotel is excellent, comparable quality than marriott and sheraton, perhaps superior, but the location is definitely much better. whatever your trip purpose is, business or leisure, you can drop your bags and take a walk on the magnificent mile. loved it!
deceptive	i was very disappointed with this hotel. i have stayed in other swissotels and enjoyed them very much, but the service can only be described as aloof. there was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure, and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information i had given her minutes ago. precise, indeed. room service took forever to pick up (good sign in a way=busy because they are good), but the food arrived very late and very cold. the man tried to replace it, but than took another hour, and i was never given a price reduction, free dessert, or anything to apologize. as for cleanliness, they must be next to godly, as they knocked on my door at 0800, despite the fact i had a doorknocker requesting no service (i'm a late sleeper.) very disappointed with my stay. this hotel clearly did not help build the chain's reputation.
deceptive	swissotel chicago: don't let the shiny bright lights of the windy city fool you. this hotel does not provide the luxurious experience or stay as you might expect. firstly, the provided appliances and room gadgets are of relatively low quality. for example, the window curtain for a small bedroom window nearly broke off it's support after trying to open them for a city view. the bedroom bed (king-sized) makes rattling noises on every turn of the body you make. of coarse, this isn't too bad once you fall asleep, until then, it sucks! in regards to room services, the hotel workers are not all that friendly. they talk to you in a stubborn way, as if they just want to get it done and over with, just to get their pay-check. yes they do all basic room service orders, but it is not all too friendly. overall, this hotel has it's much noticeable flaws on top of the positives this hotel has (which is a bare minimum). with that being said, i would not recommend this hotel for anyone around the downtown chicago area in need for at least average hotel services. however, if sub-par service and quality is okay for you, then this hotel could be suitable, however, considering it's prices, you are better off looking elsewhere for hotel rooms.
deceptive	as i walked into the hotel i was greeted warm heartedly. they took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly. i was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom. also, i was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient. overall, i was very happy with my stay at this hotel.
truthful	we recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois, while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here. i payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals ($50.00) the next day my debit card was charged $200 clearly this had to be a mistake...i called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account, routing, ss # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it. clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged. i then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake. i then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me. so for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago
deceptive	my husband and i had a wonderful time at swissotel chicago, when my husband went for a trade fair. we got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money. clean and comfortable, chic and new fixtures. the view of the pier was magnificent. staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow. it's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty.
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel is a very high quality hotel. this hotel is a very comfortal and high tech place to relax. it has everything you could possibly want to relax, workout, and feel luxurious. a must stay at hotel, i give it five stars.
deceptive	this hotel has a good name and a good location in chicago. unfortunately i was very unsatisfied with this hotel. this is a luxury hotel, so you are paying luxury prices. so, i expect to get my money's worth. unfortunately that was not the case at the intercontinental. firstly, my room was surprisingly small and unclean and could probably use a renovation and an upgrade in the furniture. again, this is supposed to be a luxury hotel, and it's expensive. i shouldn't be worried about why the carpet and other parts of the room seem dirty. i also had trouble getting the room to the temperature i wanted. i'm not sure if there was just a problem with the air condition in my room or if it's a problem in the whole hotel. the building is old and i suppose it has a lot of problems from being old. secondly, i was disappointed with the quality of the service from the hotel's staff. i thought they were somewhat rude and inattentive. thirdly, this hotel has a lot of additional expenses. i felt like they wanted to overcharge me every chance they got (use of the fitness amenities, internet, etc). when i'm already paying so much for a hotel room, i get very irritated when i feel i'm being nickel-and-dimed every chance they get. this hotel has a nice looking building, and again, it's in a terrific location. but i really don't think it's worth the expense. there are so many other hotels in chicago to choose from that are so much better.
deceptive	i stayed at the hilton chicago for my cousins wedding. the service was impeccable. not only was the staff attentive, they were respectful and careful not to interrupt the guests or make themselves known when serving dinner. i had the chicken wellington and it was to die for! the chicken was perfect and moist but the pastry crust was flaky and crispy. they even had pakistani dinner options for some of the guests. the amenities were great, and after an open bar the night before, the mimosas and brunch buffet couldn't have been better! i would love to have my wedding there.
deceptive	"i stayed at the intercontinental in chicago for my visit to set up my daughter's wedding. nina (our daughter) stated this was the place where all the higher echilon gets hitched! well i don't understand why at all. upon arrival we checked in and met nina at the ""the bar"" (how innovative) and had a light supper. the food was like airline food and cold. the waiter was annoying and in your face when he could clearly see we were not ready to have our food taken yet. when he finally came with the check we thought ""our light supper"" was all too pricey. then we were supposed to meet the sales manager erin in the lobby at 8:00 pm sharp. not sharp enough. at 8:15 a worker came over to us and stated that erin had an emergency and wouldn't be able to meet with us tonight. well that is just great. over $300 for a night and supper that would obviously be wasted. no more money will be spent here, i will guarentee that. sincerely mr. and mrs. scott grander louisville, ky"
deceptive	if you want the downtown experience of a lifetime, with historical living that will bring you back to chicago in the early 1900's look no further, the dining experience is as comfortable as the stay, service is immaculate, and just as you think things couldn't get any better, you are only a walk away from one of the most exciting cities in america: chicago with fine dining and a late night rendezvous as exciting as the nightlife, you are sure to have your excitement whims met, and walk away with the memory of a lifetime. believe me i did. valued customer, josh
deceptive	"for 250 dollars, cheapest room available at the hard rock hotel chicago, you would assume you would have access to wifi. yet, that was not the case. i was told i ""could have had"" internet if i had booked through the site, which i didnt. the lady in the reception had no idea what she was talking about and had to ask around about internet access in general."
deceptive	the fairmont chicago millenium park hotel provides a rich, beautiful, cultured atmosphere. during my stay, i felt like royalty. with unparalleled design schemes and beautiful, tranquil views, the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss. the guest services department was second-to-none. the staff throughout the hotel were obviously concerned with pleasing the customer and making my stay as wonderful as possible. when dealing with a staff member at fairmont, i felt as if i were the only guest in the place. the food and drink selections were vast and fit for a king. i will definitely recommend fairmont chicago millenium park to my friends and colleagues. i will also greatly look forward to my next stay.
deceptive	having made regular business trips to chicago, i decided to stay at the hotel monaco chicago, since it was fairly new and i had a friend that had stayed there. the lobby was quite small, which surprised me with a name like monaco. as a matter of fact i found the furnishings to be quite drab.a boy took my luggage and showed me to the suite. it was two rooms, not as spacious as i would have liked, an entertainment room, and a bedroom with a standard television. can you imagine, i was expecting h.d., but it was just ordinary cable. for $600 a night you would expect a 42 inch set. the bath was ordinary, nothing special, but the bed was a very big king.the view did not take in the lake, unfortunately, just the magic mile. well, i am starving so time to eat. the restaurant was well appointed, i hope the food was as good. i ordered lamb chops, potatoes au gratin and mint sauce. it was fair. i hope the rest of my trip si better than my accomadations. i would give this hotel a two and a half, but i would not return.
deceptive	amalifa hotel in chicago was an extremely pleasant and exciting hotel experience. i was taken away by the design and decor of the building and the exceptional customer service. i will definitely be returning for another stay!
truthful	i stayed at the allegro hotel while interviewing for a position in chicago. i read the reviews and they were mixed, but since the property was suggested by the organization (due to location), i booked a room. true to the reviews, the room was extremely small, was cold (the heater blew in cold air in -2 degree weather), and just generally uncomfortable. there was no closet so i hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room. the bathroom was extremely small and although tidy, not especially clean (it was dusty). the bed (which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full) was quite low and the sheets were hard. because i arrived late, i ordered room service. there was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk/table sideways. although there is free wireless (a plus), i kept getting kicked out of the system and had to, no lie, reconnect on-line a record 16 times. finally, to top it all off, the television stopped working just a little before midnight. i was only there for one evening (not even 12 hours) but that was enough for me. this is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but i've stayed at better 2 star properties. on the positive side, the staff is nice and friendly, the food is reasonably good, and the lobby is really vibrant. there is a martini bar (although as i was coming in, a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey) that looked interesting. overall though, not the best stay i've had. i won't be staying again.
deceptive	i enjoyed a pleasant 2 night stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago, il. the hotel was beautiful, inside and out. i felt as if i was a celebrity staying there. the staff was especially kind and very professional. my husband and i have never felt more comfortable. i was very pleased that they had transportation for us, since we flew in to chicago for our anniversary. the shedd aquarium package was an excellent bonus. i highly recommend this hotel to everyone that's going to be visiting chicago!
truthful	i stayed at the talbott twice in the last few weeks. i was very pleased with every facet of my stays. the staff, from doormen to front desk, to concierge, to housekeeping, were wonderful. the rooms were nicely sized and clean, and well stocked. i will return to the talbott anytime!
truthful	to start with, this hotel had the worst customer service. they were impossible to work with on everything! now, the problems we had in chronological order. first, we arrive at 8 pm sat. to check in. they did not have the room with 2 beds we had reserved available, so they offered us a room with one bed and a rollaway (free of charge). however, the room was not ready yet. finally at 10.30! (2.5 hrs later) we were able to get our room keys. but, there was no rollaway. another 30 mins and 3 phone calls later, we had a rollaway, but had to get the charge waived a second time. now we go to check out on mon. and they couldn't print us a bill or give us a total. we stop 3 hrs down the road to get gas only to find out that our bank card had been overdrawn $2,127.00! we called the bank and found out the hotel had ran our card through 3 times, for $709 each, when our bill was supposed to be $450. after sitting at the gas station on the phone for 1.5hrs, the money was finally put back in our account so we could continue our trip home. i would recommend a holiday inn over the intercontinental any day.
deceptive	my wife and i stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago a couple of weeks ago and will most defiantly not go back. the customer service is horrible and it is well apparent that most of the workers did not want to be there either. when we arrived at the hotel we were told us that the room was still being cleaned and had to wait almost a hour before they gave us the key. when we got into the room the bed was not even properly made. the cafe is always crowded with people and it take two hours to get food. we ended up going home two days before we planned.
truthful	the hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly, however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking. our air conditioning didn't seem to be working well, but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually... cool off. our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one a.m. that was a fax, it happened 4 times. by this time we realized that the air was not working again, so after fussing with the controls it did kick on. the next morning i mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone, but didn't think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working. after being out seeing the sites of chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show . our room was 78 degrees, i called and maintenience did come to check. after determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out. i feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel. also was very surprised that wifi was not a free service !! we will not be staying at the hilton on our next trip to chicago.
deceptive	when we got checked and arrived at our room the first thing we noticed was the light didn't come on when we flipped the switch upon entering. the room was not very clean at all. dust had collected on the back of the tv and on the stand behind it, on the window sill and stains on the carpet. we had requested wireless internet service but it was down the entire first night. the mattress was very hard making for an uncomfortable night. the jacuzzi was out of order also. when asked to be moved to a different room we were informed that there were not others available.
truthful	me and my husband stayed in the allegro hotel chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently. we got a room with a king size bed.. although the room is small, we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all. however, we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable, the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. the walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. the worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. the housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. this is unacceptable to us. the hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. although it is near the cta trains, i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. am staying again at a kimpton hotel in san fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change! overall, not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to chicago again!
deceptive	my husband and i stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend. it was far from that! we could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain, the person who answered the phone was extremely rude! we were unable to relax at all! also, the room was not very clean, there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock. we will not be returning to this awful place!
deceptive	this hotel was very poor with customer service. they were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers, and their guests. i had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning, and it took a long time to get a response. very disappointed.
deceptive	the sofitel chicago water tower, while seemingly a good idea in theory, has many drawbacks. at first glance, it appears quite luxurious and grand, but some of its shortcomings cannot be overlooked. the hotel is quite tall, coming in at 32 stories, and the noise from adjoining floors and rooms is sometimes quite annoying. the staff members do little to try to ameliorate the situation for the dissatisfied guest, so it seems as if your pleas for help go unnoticed. the hotel tries to adopt a french flavor, but its efforts fall short. the only real french influences are found in the names of restaurants and bars. the hotel is conveniently located in the heart of the city, but this location also adds to the less-than-cozy feel of the establishment. the same complaint about the guest rooms and noise applies to the hotel in general. the city's traffic and noise both detract from the ability to fully enjoy one's stay here. overall, i would not recommend this hotel. make a different choice.
truthful	my wife and i travelled to chicago and really were treated like royalty by the hotel staff! (my brother and his wife also stayed during this period.) the front desk staff, the concierge, the star bucks server, the restaurant, the lounge servers . . . all were wonderful! the rooms were spacious and the flat screen tv was really great! the bath room was a real plus ... it was huge and had everything one desires. great view from 20th floor to michigan avenue below! overall, great stay and highly recommended!
truthful	just returned from 2 nights at the ambassador and i have to say that i am very happy that i chose this hotel. it is true that this is an older hotel. but it is well kept and it does not lack in style and grandeur. (think of the hotel from the shining, minus the elevator of blood and creepy twins.) from the check-in desk to the surprise turn down service from the maids, i was made to feel like royalty. a special acknowledgment goes out to the doormen who helped me with all my tourist questions. also the location of the hotel is great. close to all the action, but on a quite residential street with beautiful old mansions. i also got a sweet $89 per night room by booking on travelzoo. that was just an added bonus however. even if i paid $200 per night, my impression of the ambassador would not change. highly, highly recommended.
truthful	stayed at the monaco for a romantic weekend getaway and it was simply fantastic. very convenient for walking to museums, shopping and park nearby. the room has a great box window that you can sit in and enjoy the view. we also requested a goldfish which was a pleasant surprise and added to the charm and uniqueness of the hotel. helpful staff, wifi, aveda products, decent restaurant downstairs for brunch, easy to get a taxi and nothing beats the location. i would definitely recommend staying at this hotel, for business or pleasure.
deceptive	the sofitel water tower was a wonderful place to stay for my husband and me for our 20th anniversary weekend trip to chicago. we got married in the city but then moved away, and it was so romantic to return. we loved how near the sofitel was to everything - the magnificent mile was just outside our door, and we could walk to navy pier and other attractions as well. chicago has changed, but the sofitel made it feel like home again... except a very plush and elegant version of home! we stayed in a junior suite, which had great views of the city, and room service was very attentive when we called for champagne after midnight the day we arrived. both nights before leaving for supper, we had a cocktail in le bar and enjoyed talking about what we'd done during the day, and all the great memories this town has for us. but i have to say we have some new great memories now, thanks to the sofitel water tower!
truthful	wow!! where do i start? booked this hotel through hotels.com for less than i paid for the travellodge downtown. check in was a breeze, the entire staff was friendly and helpful. our room was huge. the king bed was very comfortable. our room also had 2 nightstands, 2 chairs with a small table, a desk, and walk-in closet. even with all the furniture, the room was very spacious. the room did show some signs of wear, but i think this adds to the charm and the rich history of this hotel. the hotel is located in a neighborhood, so it felt like we were staying in a condo or a home rather than a hotel. there is very little noise, however, you are only about 2 blocks from rush and division streets, with all the nightlife, and the red line at clark and division is only 3 blocks away. we decided to walk to michigan ave and the next thing we knew, we were at the hancock building. by staying here, you are away from the noise, but not away from the action. had breakfast at the pump room, which is a story in itself. we had our photo taken in booth 1. take some time and research who has sat in this booth. it is impressive. some 1400 photos of celebrity guests adorn the walls of the pump room. didn't have a chance to have dinner here, but i will return for dinner someday. breakfast was not anything fancy, and a bit pricy, but the history and experience was worth it in my opinion. the waitstaff was friendly as was everyone who worked at this hotel was. i can't wait to return here!
deceptive	while travelling for business i had my family join me and we stayed at the fairmont chicago, millennium park. it is breathtakingly beautiful and plush. the rates for rooms, though not the cheapest choice are quite reasonable for such fabulous amenities. the room decor is elegant modern and my wife says the spa is divine! guests of this hotel are able to live in luxury - every room is equipped with complementary coffee, access to high speed internet, bathrobes, and 42 inch flat screen televisions. enjoy the gorgeous city views and live the good life at the fairmont chicago, millennium park.
truthful	i stayed at the talbott for 3 nights on business and was very pleased. the staff was friendly as can be immediately confirming the lore of the midwest. i was upgraded to a suite which was bigger than my apartment and certainly more luxurious. the free wi-fi came in handy as i needed to work remotely while there. everything from the comfort of the bed to the staff and location made this a great stay. oh, and i got to workout at the huge equinox right next door for free.
deceptive	don't ever stay at this hotel!, conrad chicago is the worst hotel you can imagine. first of all, the price! you not get what you pay for. i paid &217.50 one night for a room that did not even had a tv!! that's ridiculous! the bathroom did not work, and it was nasty! the bed sheets seemed like used, as if some people slept there and they smelled bad! after my experience with conrad chicago, i will please ask you to reconsider getting a room in this hotel. you get better service and accommodations even in a 1 star motel!
truthful	"booked via priceline.com for a weekend getaway and got the room for $75 per night. when we arrived via midway we took the orange line to within a block of the hotel for just $2. hotel easy to find. never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood/area. saw very few homeless or panhandlers. walked all over the place. great location and hotel is about a $5-$6 cab ride from most major attractions/shopping/restaurants. hotel is almost gawdy with colors/decor, but it's not that different from a cruise ship decor. it was not annoying decor by any means. check in was painless and the service was great! heard no noise whatsoever...the reports of ""thin walls"" are greatly exaggerated. the walls are all concrete and thick...we heard nothing both nights we were there! highly recommend this hotel! rooms are small but not crowded for two people...they are old style hotel rooms..very classic"
truthful	move beyond the rock theme and it's an average hotel with a good location. room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing. thank goodness the window opened or we'd have been cooked alive. that of course let in all the noise from michigan ave. this combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting. room was stuffy too. burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions. wife happy w/ aveda in bath. base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey.
truthful	"i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down. i got the room via pl @ $70 and was first placed in a room on the 8th floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot. since i had nothing to lose, i asked to be moved to a ""room with a view"". the front desk attendant( rasheeda) wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was. she then moved me up to the 24th floor with ease and it took about 1 minute. i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers. the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier, a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan. all this for $70? yep! i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious! the room was comfy, had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location. i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk. the bed and pillows were very comfy, but i awoke at about 330 in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed. this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again."
deceptive	the swissotel chicago was by far the best hotel i have ever stayed at in chicago. it was clean, modern, and the staff were very friendly, even to our large family with cranky kids at a very late hour. the room was fantastic and you can not beat it for the price. not only was the room fantastic, but so was the view. our room looked out over the skyline and it was breathtaking, especially at night. the best part of the hotel was its location. it was located within walking distance to so many fun attractions, including navy pier and the sears tower. our stay was wonderful, and we can't wait to go back again.
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel, in downtown chicago. during my three days there i experienced the worst service of my life! we made reservations before-hand and upon arrival our room was already booked. it took us nearly two hours to actually get into our room (after being given the wrong key!). when we entered the room, the sheets were stained with what seemed to be cherry kool-aid. i am going to assume that it wasn't. after a night on the town we were bummed for money by three homeless men outside the hotel. after arriving in our room and hoping for a nice hot shower, we found a note on our door with a ""sorry"" note explaining they didn't have any hot water. early the next morning we were awoken by housekeeping (we had a dnd sign on our door). so we decided to wake up and go out for breakfast. comes to find out our car was broken into in their parking garage. we filed a police report and the police asked the managers for a video of the surveillance. unfortunately for us their surveillance was out of memory to record anymore. needless to say we left early the next day and i will never return to such a dreadful hotel ever again."
truthful	rude, rude, rude! we stayed here on july 4th weekend. we drove from michigan, we called customer service to get directions from i-95 w/c is a major highway to chicago-- calling them from a cellphone, telling them we're in a middle of a storm and that we're lost....we were put on hold, forwarded to another person who did not know how to get to the hotel and we were on hold again. giving up we decided to just exit the highway and try our luck at a 7-11 store. when we finally arrived at the hotel at 2 am no one was there to take care of our car so we looked for parking ourselves. checking in we were not greeted by anyone, even the receptionist did not greet us!! no welcome to the knickerbocker, nothing! the man at the reception was rude, which makes me think what kind of customer service training this hotel has. the guy could not find our reservation and he seemed frustrated that we are checking-in at 2 am!! well if they were able to give us directions maybe we would have been there 2 hours earlier. the room is not even spectacular, very small, probably a little bigger than a walk-in closet. stay here at your own risk.
deceptive	i will never stay here again. i was lured in by the hotel's pictures showing a fabulous suite. instead i arrived to find cheap furniture that smelled of old cheese. i called the front desk to see if there was another room available. i was put on hold for five minutes and no one came back on the line. i ended up going to the front desk myself. i was ignored and not given assistance until i interrupted the front desk clerk who seemed to be on a personal call. the clerk apologize but then looked at me with an attitude when i requested another room because mine smelled like old cheese. i was informed that there were no other rooms available but that they would send up housekeeping. housekeeping sprayed some febreeze on the couch and then left. i tried to relax by turning on the tv in the bedroom. i sat on the bed and saw something scurry under the pillow. i checked the corner of the mattress and found bedbugs. i packed up my bags and left after that. i did get a refund on the room after some complaining. i went across town to the marriott where i had a much better stay.
truthful	my husband and i wanted to spend the weekend in chicago to celebrate our anniversary, and i had been looking at the james for awhile because it was attached to david burke's primehouse. from the moment i called to make my reservation, i knew this hotel understood what customer service means to a consumer and a picky one at that. from the pre-arrival dossier, to the special sweets from the staff to kick off our anniversary weekend and a hand written note thanking us for staying at the james, this staff is well versed in the long lost art of customer service. the rooms were well appointed and the beds comfy and warm on a cool weekend. the walking distance to michigan av is a huge plus. from the front desk to the cleaning staff, the staff here is top notch! and david burke's primehouse is not to be missed!
truthful	this hotel does not belong in the same league as the peninsula, four seasons, or ritz carlton. it was more like staying at an overpriced w hotel. staff was very nice and attentive, but the lobby is cramped, and only two small elevators for 17 floors!! several times the elevator was full by the time it reached our floor, and we were forced to take the stairs. the hotel must be flooding the travel websites itself with high reviews.
truthful	often visit chicago, but this was my first stay at this location. was able to secure a good rate through travelzoo. thought the room was clean and was nicely decorated. was very disappointed in the service. stayed on a saturday night - waited 20 minutes for extra pillows - called for 15 minutes but found out the third shift crew came in 20 minutes late. also received an incorrect folio under my door(another guests that was staying at this location). i called the front dest to inform them of the error - and they explained that this was made in error and would be corrected. i opened my credit card statement and found that i was charged for three different rooms - one on the date of my visit and two a week later. i called the hotel and guest services took the information and forwarded to their accounting department. received a message to call the billing department, have called three times - but have not received another reply back.
deceptive	the affinia in chicago obviously caters to wedding guests and corporations hosting business conferences. if you do not represent one of these groups with a large number of guests and revenue for affinia, do not expect any measure of customer service and don't expect great accommodations, even at their high prices. when we arrived our reservation was lost, then it took forever for the concierge to tell us the room we were instead given was available. the furnishings in the room were cheaply made, the cleaning obviously superficial and our view was directly into the concrete wall of the hotel's l shaped corridor. i called for fresh linens and toiletries and a very rude phone attendant told me someone would essentially be then when they had time. two hours later someone came. the dining hall and reception areas were really nice, but again, unless you're a large group don't expect to enjoy them during your stay at affinia. even if you could, the prices wouldn't be worth it.
truthful	my husband attended a conference in chicago for the weekend of june 22nd and i decided to tag along for the shopping! we flew into o'hare and took a cab to the hotel, cost about $30. everybody from the doorman to reception desk to concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. we had a room on the 9th floor which overlooked the construction, but we were hardly in the room so it didn't bother us. we were also never awakened due to construction noise and my husband is a very light sleeper. the room was clean and spacious enough for us. the bed is very comfy. we ate in the restaurant downstairs several times for breakfast and lunch and all meals were great. the location of this hotel is perfect. you are about 1&1/2 blocks from michigan ave and the hancock tower. can't beat that! there is also an adorable pet store called tails in the city across from the hotel! i brought our dog back a couple of toys! they are very nice as well. all in all, no complaints. the hotel is clean and beyond what we were expecting. the staff is always friendly and the location is superb. it's a safe neighborhood-i walked around by myself and felt fine. we would definitely return.
deceptive	"my husband and i arrived at the swissotel chicago to celebrate our 13th wedding anniversary. we automatically thought our experience would be nice because the pictures on the website and the hotel's brochure intrigued us. boy were wee wrong! upon arrival (at the given and advertised check-in time) our room was not ready. we waited for more than an hour, with our bags in hand. we checked more than twice to see if the room was ready, but the staff was less than ""warm"" both times. after a few frowns and mumbles from the people at the desk in the hotels' lobby, tired and finally arriving to our room, we expected to take a nap and hit the city. we reserved the premier corner king or so we thought. we were supposed to be able to see the lakes and rivers and the skyline. yeah, right! all we saw were the brick side of the other side of the building. in addition, the water in the shower had little pressure. we called the front desk, the phone rang for 21 times before someone answered. my husband said that he thinks that they knew we were the people calling. we requested a better room, but they said that none was available. however, they did have an upgraded room, but we would have to pay some sort of upgrade fee. we could not believe it. my husband felt that we should not ""agitate"" them any further, for fear that they might make things even worse for us: like turn off our air. we threw on some more jeans and headed fro the coffee shop around the corner that had given us refuge before. after returning about 2 hours later, the water pressure was fixed. the room was clean and the bed was plush, but the overall experience (especially the rudeness of the staff) was not good. let's just say that on our next 13th anniversary we won't stay at the swissotel and will tell others to not stay there."
truthful	"after checking out of the sofitel chicago water tower the other day, i left the hotel, crossed the street and started to walk eb on chestnut while looking for a cab. i was still within sight of a sofitel doorman when i sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same. after doing so, i immediately heard a sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle. as the cab slowed to pick me up, the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction. when the cab stopped, i quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the sofitel doorman. after locking the door, the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab. after claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs, he suggested that i had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a ""jerk"" before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination. consequently, unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen, please don't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman. lastly, as for the rest of my stay, you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in french instead of english. while i have nothing against the french or french language, i much prefer communicating in english when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world. viva la usa!"
deceptive	i recently stayed at the homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown, and found it lacking in the quality of their service. the rooms are nice and well furnished, but the service lacks in some areas. some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access, cardio-fitness and indoor pool, grocery shopping service and coffee, tea, hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby's 24 hour convenience shop. however the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times, the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned. the grocery shopping service was alright, although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality. rating this hotel on a scale of 1 to 5, i would give it a 3 at best.
truthful	my stay at the amalfi was a very brief one. i booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews i saw here on trip advisor. when i arrived, i sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk. i felt like i stepped into an episode of the twilight zone. the room was very small and dark. then the internet wasn't working. i wasn't informed about this on my check in and couldn't be given a time frame when it would be back up. i walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking, gathered up my belongings and went there. if you're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels, you'll lurve this place. but if you like a hotel with lights on, working internet and a good view and real breakfast, go someplace else.
truthful	my wife and i came to spend the weekend in downtown chicago for shopping and we found this conrad hotel well located close to everything downtown and of a size that doesn't make you feel lost in the convention world. we have had this feeling when staying at larger hotels in the past. our suite has view on michigan avenue with a bit of the lake at the end. staff was very professional, pleasant and friendly making us feel very comfortable. internet is free n the rooms and i am making my review from there.
truthful	"went to chicago for a week in may, decided to be good to ourselves and stay in the hilton, we were not disapointed. perhaps it was becuse there were quite a few conventions going on and a lot of people were only staying 1 or 2 nights but we got upgraged to exceutive level. we had 2 double beds with a bathroom each. they beds and pillows were too die for, so so comfy ant the end of a day when we seemed to have walked for miles. all the staff were very helpful. a lot of guests seemed to ignore the staff especially the chamber maids who they seemed to think they were in their way so perhaps that why some people felt these people were rude or unhelpful. about 2 blocks away on harrison is a cafe called ""orange"" which you have to make the only place you will have breakfast, the cafe and the staff are suberb. expect a 15 min wait on a sat & sun morning."
deceptive	to whom this may concern, my name is jamie brown, and i was a recent guest of yours between july 4th through july 10th, and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave. the kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine, helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to. the free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well. i really couldn't have asked for anything more! i felt like a queen and i never though i could feel that way just staying in a hotel. i thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and i will gladly be visiting you again very soon, only for more pleasure and way less business. sincerely yours, jamie brown
truthful	"this is a great hotel! from the doorman who greeted us as we arrived, to the young man at the reservation desk to the young woman serving complimentarily wine, everyone was very friendly and helpful. we were ""strangers but for a minute!"" the room was extremely clean, well appointed and we had a pretty view of the chicago river, especially enjoyed from the large window seats. loved the purple polka-dot paper on the toilet paper roll! hallways were large and quiet. the restaurant next door, south water kitchen is very nice too. the location is in walking distance of the theatres, parks, the river (take a cruise), michigan ave. it's ideal. the only negative is that the concierges were not nearly as friendly or inviting as the rest of the staff nor were they very helpful. for a self-sufficient traveler, you wouldn't really need their services (although it is nice) but for someone coming to chicago for the first time, a concierge can be very helpful. i would definately stay at this hotel again and would recommend it."
deceptive	i had heard good things regarding the plush accomidations at the talbott hotel in chicago. i thought it would be a special treat to take my 13 year old daughter to spend a weekend with mom, shopping and enjoying a bit of chicago's exciting night life. i found the talbott hotel's website and decided the american girl package they offer was what i was looking for. the price sounded reasonable, so i booked a room. the two of us were so very excited to spend some time together. we arrived at the hotel to check-in at 5:00 on that friday afternoon. after making us wait for 15 minutes while trying to find my reservation they informed me the room wouldn't be available for another hour. they blamed this on shortage of maids that day. they did manage to find us a table in one of their cafe's but this wasn't a good start to our special weekend. when we were finally allowed to go to our room we found that the doll-sized travel bed that is included in the package wasn't in the room. this disappointed my daughter, she was looking forward to that. while they did find a bed and bring it to us it just wasn't the surprise we had imagined. the rest of the weekend went by fairly smoothly. we managed to have a good time together even though the service wasn't quite what is claimed on the website. would i go to the talbott hotel again? probably not.
deceptive	"i found my stay at the hotel monaco - chicago to be less than satisfactory. they lure you in with a fancy website, promising the world and more, but their services and amenities turned out to be a facade. the pictures on the website show a grand five-star lobby and one would assume the rooms match, but when i received my room (which by the way i could barely afford) i found it to be no more luxurious than my local motel 6. they mention that they are ""pet friendly"". let me tell you, that is code for ""smelly"". there was a faint urine smell throughout the entire hotel and i was awake all night because of the incessant barking. would not stay again."
truthful	the thing that makes this such an enjoyable place to stay is the staff who were all excellent and polite and the service was impeccable. the room was very clean, the beds were comfortable but it was a little small and the water in the bathroom was not very hot. other than that it was a great place to stay.
deceptive	my stay at this hotel was one of the best i have ever had! the location, service and accommodations were all outstanding!! the lobby area is beautiful as was my room. in the room there was more than enough space, which is difficult to find in chicago hotels. my only gripe was the room was a little dark. sure, staying at a small, upper-class hotel like the talbott involves paying a premium but it was well worth it. the service was timely and everyone seemed friendly and informed. the room service took a bit longer than i would have liked, however, the food was good quality. another nice touch was the gym pass provided for guests at the equinox fitness center. finally, the location is perfect!! it's located in a beautiful area of the city near the gold coast, which has many very good restaurants. a personal favorite of mine is mario's, a nice italian place nearby. overall, my experience at the hotel was good and while it had some minor flaws they were, for the most part, insignificant.
deceptive	the stay at the hilton chicago definetely felt like a vacation. sleeping in that big wonderful bed felt like i was at home! the accommodations and hotel are beautiful. i especially enjoyed the gym. the staff was friendly and helpful. i would reccommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a home away from home.
truthful	hi,stayed here for three nights recently,from check in to check out all staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us,directions,restaurants, transport,nothing was too much trouble,the dinner from monday to thursday 5-7 was a wonderful surprise,also the breakfast was more than adequet,stayed on the 15th floor and slept soundly,hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller.restaurants and shopping all within 5-10 mins.
truthful	my wife and i spent several nights here on a getaway excursion. i didn't choose it -- priceline gave it to me for $70. if i'd paid the book rate, $175, i'd have been less pleased. no troubles with checkin. very small room but bed was clean and comfortable. starbucks in the lobby was a godsend. i'd read horror stories about the staff but they seemed friendly enough. for $70, it's a steal. for its online face value, not so much. will definitely return if can get similar price.
deceptive	the atmosphere at the talbott hotel is very welcoming when you first walk in. the employees are friendly and will greet you when you first arrive. the hotel seems to be luxurious, even from the lobby, and right away, i was very excited for my stay! i stayed in a double queen room with my friend. the room is spacious enough, and beds are very comfortable. i didn't try the room service, but they do have a fitness club close by with a spa, which is very convenient. i also love how the room has individual climate controls! very neat! also handy that there is an ihome in the room. i'm usually stuck using just a regular alarm clock radio at other hotels. i will most likely stay in this hotel another time. it was a wonderful experience!
deceptive	what a terrible experience my family and i had at affinia chicago! first of all, we reserved a room with 2 queen size beds and received only 1 king size bed with a cot. when we got to the room, we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there. what an absolute terror affinia was and i will never be going back!
deceptive	the ambassador east hotel hello my current visit to the ambassador east hotel. i really enjoy my 3 day weekend stay at this hotel. this was my first time at the hotel and i reserved a king size suite. inside my room there was nice view of chicago's gold coast. i really needed to get some work done for my business trip and this room was perfect for the situation. i could easily relax on my king size bed. i watch hbo on a enormous size flat screen tv for free. also when i did do my work there was nice wooden desk in my room with a desk lamp and wifi modem. it so nice to have my laptop with me and able to use it on a good workstation in my room. after finishing my work i have time to check the complimentary fitness room. lastly i left the next day, i had one of the finest breakfast dishes from their pump room restaurant. overall the ambassador east hotel is a 5 out 5 hotel and really worth the stay.
truthful	"not worth the price, even a little bit. a week prior to scheduled check-in, receiving an email for a room upgrade and accepting, of course, upon arrival, nobody knows about it. typical. after nobody was doing anything about it, i notified them of this stay's review will be posted on the newly-developing thechicagocritic . com, all of a sudden they figured out the problem and even offered an early check-in. too little, too late. very small room with 2 queens instead of the ""select king"" i was supposed to have. windows didnt open, tv took forever to change channels and the bathroom fan was not controllable. the faboulous lodge net system that every hotel in the world uses for ease of checkout for guests, well there was no check out feature. this shit hole couldn't hold a candle to the las vegas hard rock!"
truthful	"i never write these reviews, but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the #1 2008 travelers choice. terrible service, lazy doormen/bellmen/concierge/valet, lack of respect, allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints, phantom charges to room, front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus. the icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son, and the doorman watched on doing nothing. me and my girlfriend are young, look young in how we dress, but in all honesty make more money than most...and we were treated like cheap poor kids. i had dinner reservations at spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up, the concierge exclaimed that, ""you know its not jeans and running shoes right mr. blank?"" assuming i was too dumb to realize that a 5 star $200/person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because i am young? very dissapointed. very nice looking, comfortable beds, great room service, contemporary, younger crowd, but service was terrible."
deceptive	when i was asked to stay at the swissotel in chicago, i immediately went to their website to check them out. what i found there was decent, nothing really stood out. it wasn't until i actually went there that my eyes were opened. the amazing customer service i received there was exceptional. every whim and detail i asked for they helped me perfectly. the room was neatly fixed when i arrived and was cleaned every day. when i asked about more towels, the maids were happy to help me out. if i were ever to be in that area again, i know exactly where i'm staying, the swissotel.
deceptive	"i have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel. the omni chicago's age shows, and not in a ""great ambiance"" way! the rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking. i say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor, almost like mildew, that permeated the first room we were given. seriously, it brought tears to my eyes! the staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma, but finally agreed to switch us to another room. the new one didn't smell, but was clearly past its prime. housekeeping was almost nonexistent. we had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels. how can you forget to leave towels for the guests? i'm not one to complain, but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here, we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment. we received neither and will not be returning to the omni chicago."
truthful	i have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and i can honestly stay that the james is tops. the service at the hotel is first class. the rooms are modern and very comfortable. the location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants. highly recommend to both business travellers and couples.
truthful	at check in, the girl gave us a smoking room. we asked for nonsmoking. i had to get another room. it was by the elevators. loud! really loud!. the new room didn't have a shower door. so every day water spilled on to the floor and wet the carpet. the public transportation is amazing. you don't need a car in chicago. you can get anywhere by train or bus. it's fast too. area recommendations chicago is great! good shopping, good food (ginos east!!!) and great bars. the tornado that knocked out the windows in the sears tower was really cool! i loved being in the hardest rain storm i've ever seen!
truthful	my family of four went to a convention and stayed here in early august. we were promised a room with two double beds. when we arrived (earlier than most) we were told they were 45 double beds short. we reluctantly agreed to take a room with a king bed and a promise of a roll away bed. we had a to sleep very uncomfortably with a 12 year old in our bed and our other child in the roll away. little did we know we were being charged a daily fee for this bed. the managment could not handle the large group that was at this hotel. the bellhops and bartenders were visibly stressed and we did not have towels one day until very late at night. the managers would not take off the roll away bed charge and were not the least bit accomodating. we were so disappointed in this hotel. also, they do not have a pool here. if you want to use a pool there is a health club next to the hotel but you have to pay $20 a day to use it. $80 for a family to take a little swim was a bit ridiculous. do yourself a favor, if you want to be accomodated and are thinking of booking this hotel for a convention or otherwise, go elsewhere. chicago has too many hotels to choose from to pick this one. i never heard back from managment on this issue when i called and emailed so obviously they don't care, even when i told them i'd write a review on this website. chicago is an awesome city though. we loved it!
deceptive	i recently traveled up to chicago for business and had a terrific 3 day 2 night stay at the sofitel chicago water tower in downtown. the location was perfect as it gave me easy access to michigan avenue and the conference center where i was doing business. my hotel room was rather nice with a very comfortable king size bed and a cozy atmosphere. i ordered room service for dinner and it came within 30 minutes so i was quite pleased with that and they serve from their own restaurant which is located downstairs. the food was extremely good and i really enjoyed not having to go out and fight the traffic to find a good place to eat. i had been really tired from my meeting earlier in the day and had no trouble going to bed on the comfortable mattress. i woke up and took a shower and the bathroom was definitely up to standard with any other quality hotel. they had all the soaps and stuff as usual and they had plenty of towels on hand as well. after shower i headed down and they had a breakfast buffet at the restaurant which was free for hotel guests. the breakfast was delicious and started my day out right. after my business stuff was over i really got out and enjoyed chicago. i met up with a friend who came over and visited my hotel and she was quite impressed with it as well. when i go back to chicago i will definitely stay at the sofitel again.
truthful	my in-laws booked a one night stay for new years eve for the two of us to stay at the james. to be brief there were a few things wrong with our stay which will prevent us from returning and advising our friends not to stay there. 1) shoddy construction of room fixtures: ceiling light was missing leaving a fist-sized hole with wires exposed, both towel racks fell off the wall without being touched, and bathroom door often came off it's sliding mechanism with gentle use. 2) when we reported these problems, employees simply put the towel racks back on the wall without properly adhering them to the wall. 3) upon check-out, they did not have record of my in-laws paying for our stay, though it was noted on our reservation that they had made it for us. we had to pay for our ($300) gift and the in-laws were extremely upset. when we wrote a letter to management (as a manager was not available to speak with us when we left) we did not receive an adequate apology.
truthful	if you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you're willing to pay a little extra, i'd recommend this place.also, pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular.a short walk to michigan avenue. excellent service from the valets, concierge, lobby agents, and waitstaff in the restaurants. the food in the restaurants was great and room service wasn't too shabby either.well worth the money!
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel is not pretty as they advertise it. first of all, it really difficult to get there because its located in down town chicago and they fail to mention that the traffic is a nightmare. if you finally make to the hotel you have to wait like 30 minutes for the front desk to take care of you. when i arrived there was one person at the desk and a few people checking in, and i thought the wait time was ridiculous. to make matters worse, i need internet connection and the day i was there they had technical problems and the internet was not working in my room. two hours later they managed it get to work, the connection was still very slow. for my part, the hotel might look nice but services is did not meet my expectations. i was disappointed and will never stay there again, if i go back to chicago. if was rating it, i would give it 1/2 star out of 5.
deceptive	"we stayed at the schicago hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference. i have to say, normally i am very easy going about amenities, cleanliness, and the like...however our experience at the hilton was so awful i am taking the time to actually write this review. truly, do not stay at this hotel. when we arrived in our room, it was clear that the carpet hadn't been vacuumed. i figuered, ""okay, it's just the carpet."" until i saw the bathroom! although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned (i.e., a paper band across the toilet, paper caps on the drinking glasses, etc., it was clear that no actual cleaning took place. there was a spot (probably urine!) on the toilet seat and, i kid you not, the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass. i know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things ""appear"" clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary. well, the hilton was proof. i called downstairs and complained, and they sent up a chambermaid hours later. frankly, i found the room disgusting. the hotel itself, outside the rooms, was cavernous and unwelcoming, with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din. rarely have i been so eager to leave a place as this. when i got home, i washed all my clothes whether i had worn them or not, such was the skeeviness of our accomodations. please, do yourself a favor and stay at a clean hotel."
truthful	i was attending a conference at the mariott. they were booked up and i shared a room at the hard rock for a week by default. what a lucky break. this is a beautiful hotel. i am not a fan of all that black/grey vibe and find it a little cheesy. what i loved was the way the hard rock left the beautiful old hotel features intact, and decorated around the basic stucture. my room was clean, clean, clean. i want to comment on the staff. what an upbeat group of people. this included the doormen, the front desk, the consierge. they were wonderful! every morning one of the bell men would find my tv morning news show for me in the bar, while i drank their courtesy coffee. they brought us a refrigerator, ipod dock, and extra suitcase stand within minutes of check-in. i had a hard time contacting the airport transport. the consierge took care of it for me. while i was waiting for the 4:50 am airport shuttle, one of the bell men found me a cup of coffee in the back. i just couldn't get over how nice and friendly everyone was....great place to stay. i hope to go back with my husband.
deceptive	my husband and i were sorely disappointed in this hotel. we had requested a non smoking room, and right off we were hit with the stinch of stale cigarettes when we opened the door. the front desk was not responsive to our needs at all, but we did finally get moved to a new room. the water pressure in the shower was hardly enough to get the shampoo out of our hair and the beds were lumpy. i was very disappointed in the workout room, it was very small so i decided to swim laps instead, but when i got to the pool it didn't look like it had been maintained all week. needless to say we won't make the mistake of staying with homewood suites again.
deceptive	the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare! when we got there our room wasn't done! we were not offered anything to do, drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the 20 minutes that they said it would be finished. the clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone! how rude! we were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done. and after waiting that long for the room, can you believe it? there was a dirty towel in the bathroom. the television didn't work, we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it. plus, the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair. i'm so mad i'm writing the owners and letting them know! this really made me mad. we haven't taken a vacation in years and i was expecting the fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs. even the concierge snickered at my boots, so what, i like to wear doc martens! it makes me mad even thinking about the fairmont. at least my time in chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame.
deceptive	don't let the website fool you. i stayed at the amalfi hotel chicago on my last business trip, and this was probably one of the worst 4 star hotel i've ever stayed at. the website makes the place look like a 4 star hotel but it's more on par with a 2 stars or 3, if you want to be generous. first off, the rooms are not as nice or clean as they look in the picture. the room that i checked into was dingy with paint peeling from the walls, and the carpet looked like it hadn't been vacuumed since god knows when. since i was only staying one night, i decided not to ask for a different room- although i don't know if asking for a different room would've made any difference considering the lack of hospitality from the reception desk. when i arrived, there were two receptionists chatting it up- no acknowledgement, no prompt service. i had to wait about 3 minutes although i was the only one in line before any of them acknowledged me. and no, they weren't talking about hotel matters. i'm not a difficult or an especially picky person, and who doesn't chat during work with their co-workers but for them to completely ignore and make a client wait for 3 minutes shows serious lack of professionalism. do yourself a favor, and go stay at the marriott if you want service- unless the price is tempting but you get what you pay for.
deceptive	what a disappointment this hotel was. first, the checkin desk was understaffed and we had to wait forever to get through the line to check in. when we finally got up to our room, we opened the door and found someone else was already in it! yes, the front desk clerk actually checked us into an occupied room and basically gave us a key to someone else's room. we went back to the clerk who checked us in (skipping the still present line, which got us annoyed stares from the other people waiting) and told him the problem. however, he was already helping another guest checkin and made us wait until he was done with that person before helping us. he did apologize for the mix up and then went into the back room to find out what to do. this took a *very* long time. it was a good 10-15 minutes until he came back. he said there were no more rooms available of the type we had booked and the only ones they had left were on a lower floor with no view. the hotel offered us a discount off the regular price for these, but when we got to this new room, we found out why these rooms hadn't been taken. the room was overlooking the loading dock at the back of the hotel. we briefly considered just leaving and going to another hotel, but it was late already so we just decided to make do. that was, of course, until the garbage truck came around 6am and made all sorts of noise picking up the dumpsters and dropping them back down. then somewhere around 7:30am the delivery trucks started showing up making that beep-beep backup sound and all sorts of other noise. so much for a good night's sleep. i suppose i should say the room itself looked nice, but with all the noise from the loading dock, who cares. we gave up and checked out that morning to find another hotel. definitely not going back here ever again.
truthful	this hotel is very busy and is operating way beyond their means. incompetent service. hotel ran out of hot water by 9am saturday. elevators were very slow, waited 10 minutes on any given event. red line trains ran every 10 minutes beneath city streets and you can hear the thunder in your room from them but it shouldnt keep you awake at night. used my stay toward nw airlines bonus points. bar was ok. one cup coffee service was awful. no free wireless and no free cable channels. fridge was 25 bucks a day to use. with http://hotels.com res got it for 65 bucks with tax so what can you expect.?.... location was superb and cab service was convenient but not enough to outweigh the negatives.
deceptive	"the hotel monaco claims to be a ""boutique chicago luxury hotel,"" but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish. the pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view, but that was certainly not the case for this customer! the decor, which might be ""cutesy"" or ""charming"" to some was actually quite tacky and outdated. the bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be ""one of the top 40 hotels u.s."" don't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos--this hotel does not live up to its billing. you will be disappointed, as was i, if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel."
deceptive	"this hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere. it smells because pets are allowed. this hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed. there was mold in our room and bathroom, pet hair everywhere! kids love pools. how can they claim to be kid friendly without one? my kid was bored. the food was basically the same every day, no variation in the menu. pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their ""travel club"" because our room didn't even remotely resemble the pictures. they did the old bait and switch. we reserved a ""family room"". when we opened the door of our room, we realized that it wasn't what the website pictured or had what the website described. we kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers. definitely do not recommend this hotel!!!"
truthful	ideal location right in the heart of the near north side but good grief, they need more than two elevators. you can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor (registration desk on 6th floor), you can face a long line just to catch one. rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all homewood suites - very utilitarian; unlike many locations however, this one does not include a dvd player in the rooms. the pool is ok but there's no jacuzzi. oh, and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area. front desk service is pretty good.
deceptive	although the architecture of the hotel is quaint, that is about the only positive of this terible hotel. the guest services were unhelpful at best, and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful. and as for the rooms, small, cramped, and it seemed as if the sheets hadn't been cleaned in the last 5 years. my stay here was distasteful, and i never intend to return, except to ask for my money back.
deceptive	"i have just returned from my first stay at the remodeled fairmont chicago millennium park and all i can say is fabulous! the modern decor and style hits you the minute you walk in. the front desk is a work of art. i stayed in the anything but standard guestroom. the modern decor, the beautiful artwork, this is the most relaxing hotel room i have ever stayed in. the bathroom is like having your own personal spa, all the marble tile is classic and modern at the same time. the rainfall showerhead is to die for people. if you have the time be sure to check out the fitness center and spa. great new equipment to work up a sweat and all the pampering a body could ever needs awaits in the spa. i wish i could have stayed longer, next time i will be sure to add a couple of ""me"" days to my trip and i'm sure i won't even think of going outside those doors."
deceptive	i travel often and whenever i travel i prefer to stay at hilton properties. i am always satisfied with my stay at hilton. locations. however, i have never stayed at a homewood suites location. this property was awesome and it was great to have the same satisfication when i arrived. the lobby area was excellent and the greeting from the front desk staff was wonderful! my room was in great condition! absolutely no complaints. i just figured that a property like this should be recognized. great job staff!!!! i will definitely return in the future!
deceptive	i stayed in the sofitel chicago water tower hotel with my husband and two kids last weekend, and will definitely use this hotel again for future travels. the spacious rooms with modern, innovative furniture and comfortable beds was a great contrast to the small, dismal rooms and rock-hard beds that i have found at other hotel chains. the bathrooms were neat, tidy, and well-stocked with towels and personal needs such as toilet paper, shampoo, and soap. the carpet was clean (not stained and dingy like some hotels), the room decor was astounding, and the view from our window was wonderful. i enjoyed every aspect of this hotel stay, from the courteous staff at check-in to the ease of requesting room service and checking out. thanks for making me feel right at home!
deceptive	i was visiting chicago for a christening with my fiance. i was impressed with this hotel from the moment i checked in. the lobby was exceptionally modern with color and furnishings. front desk staff was pleasant and helpful, especially susan, who quickly suggested and reserved a table for us at keefer's steakhouse for a late dinner. the room itself was fabulous. extremely comfortable king sized bed, dual head shower, breathtakingly beautiful views of the city, i couldn't ask for more. after a great nights sleep we awoke to a great free breakfast right outside our room! next we enjoyed a couple's massage and i was treated to a facial as my fiance took a short run through the city. after a day full of shopping we retired to our room and ordered room service that was on time and delicious. unfortunately we checked out the next day, because i could have stayed there forever. i fully recommend the amalfi hotel chicago for everyone interested in a superior stay. it is truly a beautiful and well appointed hotel.
truthful	the hard rock is glossy and sexy, but an absolutely fantastic hotel.... i was in town for business and stayed here because of it's location, but i absolutely understand why tourists would like it...right on the river, cool art deco building and millenium park is just down the street. regardless- the room was clean, the staff was friendly, but not annoying and the bar was fun. i was comfortable having a couple of drinks alone at the end of the day - they were good! i'll definitely try it again!
deceptive	i stayed at the swissotel chicago while i was on holiday recently and i have to say, that you definitely get what you pay for! i was initially attracted by their inexpensive prices for the luxury that they promised. i was sorely mistaken. the first problem i had was when i got there they told me that they had double booked the suite i had reserved. they gave me a discount but had to downgrade me to a regular room. i should have left then but i decided to keep an open mind. after we were all settled in my husband and i went to the palm restaurant. my husband has food allergies and they got his order wrong so we had to send it back three times. each time we asked them to fix it, they stormed off angrily and would return in a huff. after dinner, we went back to our room. just sitting on the bed i knew it would be a long night. the mattress was hard and the blankets had a bad smell to them. when i went to the restroom, the toilet had not been cleaned from the previous patrons! my husband grabbed a blanket out of the car and we used it instead of the smelly one. we just didn't want to bother the desk staff after the cold reception when we had walked in. i tried their massage service the next day and the massage therapist was very unprofessional. he pressed really had and hurt my back. perhaps it was because he was distracted with all the texting he was doing off and on throughout the session! for lunch we tried geneva restaurant in the hotel and the food was not cooked all the way. i decided to eat it anyway and got food poisoning about an hour later! once i got sick, i was done. i went to the desk and demanded a refund for the next two nights because i was not going to sleep there one more night. i made a formal complaint with the manager who seemed to act like it was our fault and that we were being unreasonable. after a lot of arguing, he finally refunded us and we went to a different hotel. this was the worst place i had ever stayed! i think a super 8 motel would have been more luxurious!
truthful	"was there recently for one night for a conference. tried to check-in at 5:30pm (the published check-in was 3pm), they said my room wasn't ready, where as others coming after me were assigned rooms. was given a dummy door key card and asked to chill in the lounge on the 32nd floor and that they would call on may cell as soon as the room was ready. i chilled there until 8pm, no call, so went out for dinner. came back at 9:30pm and asked if my room was ready. the gal said of course yes and give me a key. when asked why no one called me, she just shrugged. no, my troubles did not end there. i went to the room and opened the door only to find someone else in the room. came back to the lobby, then they apologized and gave me another room. i said i was not going to walk-in on somebody else again, so they sent someone with me to open the new room. for all my ""trouble"" they reduced my bill by about 40%. it was definitely not worth the trouble they put me thru. very bad experience."
deceptive	when we arrived the check in process was fairly quick, however the staff seemed in a bad mood all around. they seemed as if we were taking up their time. when we got to the room we tried to use our personal computer to look for attractions, and after having to pay $10 a day for wifi it was a total waste of money the speed of the internet was extremely slow. the free workout area was also not up to our expectations but since it was free we didnt complain. overall we would never stay at this hotel again and we do not recommend it.
deceptive	i traveled to chicago with my husband for a romantic weekend away. our stay at the sofitel chicago water tower could not have been more luxurious! our room had anything you could ever want, a mini bar, air conditioning. we were also within walking distance of many sites and fun restaurants. the staff was friendly, and the beds were like clouds. overall,the experience was worth every penny.
truthful	i just left the conrad chicago and have nothing but good things to say. we used hilton points to stay there but paid $35/night to upgrade to a junior suite. we were in room 1519. i would reccomend people ask for an odd numbered room so that they will have a view looking north on michigan ave. our room was very modern with 2 large hd/flat panel tv and bose 3 speaker sound system. 4 big windows that actually open. the bed lineds were very nice, the towels were ok. the room was clean and the bath room had a seperate shower and tub. marble everywhere. robes, slippers, etc. the work out room was good with different machines and some free weights. there are clean towels in the workout room too. we never ate in the hotel so i can't comment on the food or the prices. there is a starbucks across the street (michigan) and an espresso bar attached to the nordstrom that is on the ground floor of the hotel. it was very nice to have the little mall right under the hotel. the location of the hotel could not be better. we were walking distance to everything. every kind of shopping or dinning experience you could possibly want was within 2 miles. over all the hotel had a boutique feel to it even though it is part of the hilton chain.
deceptive	"chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers. when visiting the windy city, however, the conrad hotel and resort is one to avoid. while the description promises clean accommodations, luxury amenities, and ""deep soaking tubs,"" in relity, the rooms fall short of expectations. i opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet. a bit disappointed, i decided to ignore this fact. hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels, i made my way to the bathroom. while i did find a large, deep bathtub, there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look. hardly what i expected for the price i paid for the accommodations. in the corner of the bathroom, i found a reminder of a pevious guest, a clump of blond hair. the maid service seemed to be lacking. not to be deterred from enjoying my stay, i decided to watch television on the 42 inch flat screen i had been promised. unfortunately, the battery to the remote control was dead. i called the front desk, at my wits' end, to complain about the issues, but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word. overall, i would definitely not recommend the conrad hotel and resort in chicago. my room was dirty, the staff was unfriendly, and the ammenities were few and far between. on my next stay in chicago, i will definitely stay elsewhere."
truthful	i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago and found it to be a fantastic hotel. staff was always courteous and helpful - from the front desk staff at check-in to wait staff in aria restaurant, to the maid who cleaned my room. the rooms were recently updated, with large flat-screen tv's, beautiful linens, and exceptional toiletries in each room. my room even had a view of monroe st. harbor. it is truly a first-rate hotel. location is south of the river and east of michigan ave -- as we normally stay north of the river it seems a little out of the way (if that's possible in downtown chicago), however its location significantly lowers street noise. the hotel has excellent access to millennium park, the aon center (there is a connecting concourse), and is about 4 blocks from shopping on north michigan ave. i ate dinner in aria and it was fantastic! room service for breakfast was quite good as well. overall, i'd stay again in a minute if i had business in the loop, or leisure plans in millennium or grant parks.
truthful	i loved this hotel. the room was so chic and trendy, the bed was comfortable, great slippers and robes. i love the keihl's bath products in the bathroom. we went during my birthday weekend, and they had a card and plate with pastries waiting in the room. we got a great deal on a junior suite from travelzoo, but when we tried to take another trip to chicago, the deal was gone. i really recommend the hotel. i loved it. the only problem we had was with the david burke steakhouse. the service was horrible, they switched our order with the table next to our's and the only compensation was they took off a $7 side dish we ordered (and they were nice enough to not charge us for the other side dish we didn't get). don't go there. go to the lawry's accross the street. but stay at the james. (btw- its not a 3-star hotel like the website lists- its at least 4-star)
truthful	my wife and i stayed two nights at the talbott at the end of february. this little hotel was the perfect place for us. the lobby is very small but also cozy, and with both fireplaces going it was a welcoming atmosphere coming in from the cold. the staff was very friendly and efficient. the room was pretty spacious, and the king bed was extremely comfortable. we had a seventh floor room facing delaware st, so there was really no view. the bathroom was a good size, including two sinks and a spacious tub/shower. there was also free wireless internet...a big plus for us. perhaps the best thing about the talbott is the location. we were only a few steps from state, rush, and north michigan. tons of shopping, bars, and good food are easily within walking distance. this makes the talbott a great place for tourists who want to walk around and take everything in. we highly recommend the talbott, and will gladly stay again on return trips.
truthful	we stayed at the swissotel for our 25th anniversary. we got a corner room with both a lake and city view. the room was very clean and spacious. the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. we asked for late checkout, and was told no problem. if you bring your car, park in millinum parking it is just 2 blocks away. the cost there is $14.00 compared to the swissotel which is $41.00.
truthful	my wife and i stayed here for a long weekend and it was great. the check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question, and the bar served the best martini i have had in a while. the rooms were well decorated and spacious, although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door. the bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late. i would definitely stay here again!
truthful	"i booked this hotel for my family of 4 to stay overnight to see the magnificent mile christmas lights parade. i chose it because it had a sofa sleeper and one bed. we arrived at our hotel around 3:30 pm to check in. we came at this time because the front desk worker said that we could not check in until 3:00 pm. after giving him our name, the manager said,""ok, we have your king smoking suite available"". we quickly corrected him to let him know that we were traveling with two very young kids and we reserved a non-smoking room. he insisted that his computer said that we reserved a smoking room. we went back and forth, then he asked us if we had a copy of our reservation. luckily, we were able to pull the reservation up on our phone. it clearly said non-smoking. after showing him our reservation, he explained that there was nothing that he could do to correct the situation because they had no other rooms available. so why in the world did he need to see our reservation!! we decided to see if we could handle the smoking room. it turns out that the entire floor was smoking and for a non smoker there was no way that we could sleep in a smoking room on a smoking floor with our two young children. the manager eventually called around and found a hampton inn near by with one bed. we canceled our room reservation. we live about an hour away from downtown so we made the late night trip back home. my family was very disappointed. my husband is a gold member with hilton. let's just say we will be switching back to marriott. the hotel lobby was dated. the smoking room that i saw looked very dated as well. they made an error and never owned up to it, nor did they do anything to compensate us for such a huge inconvenience."
deceptive	the james chicago hotel is located right in the heart of the one and only, downtown chicago. this wonderful hotel has many classy and down to earth boutique's, and the views are breath-taking. the hotel just has a warm feeling to it, and the hotel staff is more than excellent. this hotel is situated right across from the magnificent mile, and only minutes away from the world famous shopping, dining, and fun for all ages. the james is modern and luxurious. the james is definately a hotel that i would recommend and will go back to in years to come.
deceptive	if you're looking for an elegant hotel in downtown chicago, you have to stay here. the ambassador east hotel has very comfortable and beautiful large rooms and is like a home away from home. the perfect place for a business person, and if you have a small pet you can bring them too! i would give this place four stars and would definitely stay here again.
deceptive	do not stay here!! my wife and i were visiting family in chicago and decided to stay at the james. we had stayed at the james in new york happily so we came in with good expectations. what a mistake. our room looked nothing like the ones pictured on the website. the bathroom was dirty and the bedding and furniture were disheveled. there was also a musty odor to the room. when we called the front desk to complain they were quite rude. we ended up leaving and staying in a different hotel for the duration of our stay.
truthful	the room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel. the carpet was exceptionally worn, wallpaper peeling, bathroom grout dingy. the place felt like it hadn't been redecorated in 30 years. on top of that, the windows would not open (not unusual for a hig-rise hotel), and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work, i have no idea (they said 'radient cooling' whatever that is), but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation. we even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated. so much for privacy. i can't comment on the food, because we ate out at every chance. chicago has some fantastic food! and much of it within easy distance to the hotel. the hotel is in a good location, near the waterfront and millenium park, shopping and dining. the conference facilities were average, but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent. i will never stay in this hotel again, especially for the price, because of the poor room quality.
truthful	i chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed. the previous weekend, i stayed at a 2.5 star hotel a few blocks away, and was much more impressed there. the hard rock had a number of issues including: very dark room - not much light (artificial or natural); lots of street noise; very cheap decor and furniture; broken cabinet door; very warm room - said they would send maintenance, but they never arrived; had bar charges on account that were not ours. overall, i was very surprised that this was a 4 star hotel. i expected a much better experience!
deceptive	first stepping foot on the hotel propety i could tell it was a negative place, seeing as how there was what apperd to me to be vice lords all aroung the property. not that i have a personal problem or affelated with another gang, it's just the way they was acting, drinking the hotels cheepest wine, they could of been there for securaty purpouses like the hell's angels was to some concerts. walking in the hotel i oder hit me. it smelled like a cretan type of burning wood that i have smelled, only later to find out it was the smell of rock cocine. i looked at the pool only to find there was no watter and scateborders all around the place. me being a high class bizness man, i decided to leave.
truthful	apart from the location, great, but it stops there. upon check-in, i was informed i would have a queen bed. i asked for a king size bed, and i was told there would be a charge for going up to a king. give me a break, a surcharge for going from a queen to a king. when i got up to the room, it was like a oven. i could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service. everything in the room had a charge associated to it, even down to the coffee, $1.00. now what's up with that? i was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom. very small. i have stayed there twice and with so many other options, i feel this will be my last.
truthful	the knickerbocker hotel is fantastic! it's an old hotel with updated rooms - so you get the old-timey charm and fresh comfort all at once. the hotel has a fabulous location. it's a one minute walk to the cheesecake factory and bloomingdales, and about a 5 minute walk to einstein bagel company (the best bagels and cream cheese ever), macys and saks. this location can't be beat. you're at one end of the magnificent mile, so it makes for easy strolling, as you don't start in the middle and then backtrack. the hotel staff are super helpful and friendly. checking in and out was very smooth, and the concierge (cheryl) was amazing. she booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us, and recommended an incredible restaurant called carmines which was a 5 minute walk. it was the greatest italian restaurant i have ever been to, and i can't recommend it more. the rooms are small but not too small. we had a beautiful big samsung flat screen, cordless phones, a rain shower, ample clean towels, and beautiful marble countertops. the hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like i was at a 5 star hotel in europe. the beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter. the only complaint i had was that housekeeping woke us up at 8:30 one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on. when we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed. the issue was corrected, though, and it didn't happen again during our 4 night stay. the hotel has some unique items on their room service menu - ie - grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping. very cute. their late night menu, however, is lacking. it would have been nice to see some soup on there. that being said, i rarely order from room service when on vacation, so i really don't see that being a big deal. overall i would recommend this hotel without hesitation. i think we paid about 130 a night and i would say it was worth far more than that. we had a wonderful experience and i truly look forward to staying there again....wouldn't stay anywhere else!
deceptive	a few nights ago, i stayed at the hotel allegro in the theater district of chicago. i'd heard some amazing things about the great food, and how friendly the staff were. upon arrival, the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! they treated me as if i stayed there all the time! the rooms were cozy, with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. i ordered breakfast the next morning, and had room service bring it up. the meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering, and was delicious! i would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling, or any families staying in chicago, as the rooms were very reasonably priced, and is a short distance to lots of great sites. next time i come through chicago, i will definitely be staying here!
deceptive	i will never use ambassador east hotel again. the first appearance you get is a very dark and dreary type setting. the exterior of the hotel was in desperate need of repair. the customer service was not as good as you would expect when spending your hard earned money on a hotel room. in this hotel you are spending more than the average amount of money on a room that is smaller than the average hotel room. i felt rushed out at check out and didn't have an enjoyable experience at all.
truthful	"this is a stylish hotel located right on north michigan avenue, a five minute walk from the orange ""loop"" line that will get you to and from midway airport. forget about taking a taxi: the train is a $2 ride and less than 40 minutes away. our room (1802) was immaculate and spacious (350 sq ft, we were told). decorated in grays and white, the room was comfortable and soothing, not jarring. on the other hand, we found the lighting to be very poor and had trouble reading, finding keys, etc. no kidding. the bathroom was also quite dark and it didnt have a heating lamp. on the positive side, however, there were aveda products in the bathroom, the windows were huge, so during the day there was tons of natural light, and no issues with darkness. the king size bed was very firm, but had a plush pillow top which made it very comfortable and inviting. we had a largish tv with a dvd player. there is a safe and munchies. the gym is perfect, equipped with treadmills, ellipticals, bikes and weights. it is open 24/7 and there is video surveillance for safety. there are towels, water, headphones, disposable ear pads, and complimentary green apples. suggestion: if you are on a floor below the 22nd, take the elevator up to 22nd, then down to l2 to get to the gym. this way you dont have to traverse the lobby. the front desk staff is amiable, and very attentive. i read some other reviews about nasty personnel, but did not have that experience at all. i got a free newspaper with a smile, a free stamp when i needed it, change and all the coffee i could tolerate in the morning. the hard rock is located less than a 20 minute walk from the water tower, the drury theater, john hancock, and magnificent mile. for those who like a thrifty breakfast, we recommend gourmet pantry at 155 n. michigan avenue [--]. this deli made a delicious egg on a toasted roll with butter on a sunday morning, no less: $1.99. the hotel has a breakfast buffet for $15.00 per person, but we did not partake of it. we would stay at the hard rock again, and think it is great for people with ""tweens."" not sure about the toddler set, though."
truthful	we stayed in the amalfi in july 2010, 4th of july weekend. i was very apprehensive about leaving my diesel ford excursion with the valet at amalfi. it has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly. i explained the procedure to the valet drivers, and felt like it was a complete waste of time. when the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as i had instructed. when i tried to start it, it wasn't happy, but did finally start. i was so relieved to get it back i just wanted to leave. driving away i noticed that the top speed recorded on the gps was 105mph!!! (previous top speed was 95mph, done a few days earlier driving across south dakota). i could just picture the flying ferrari scene in ferris bueller's day off. i couldn't imagine where in the crowded chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast, though it wouldn't take long to make that happen (see reference to modified engine above). a little while later we stopped for lunch and i noticed a dent in the front bumper. i contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people. no remedy. lesson learned. brett
truthful	i've stayed at the allegro a couple of times. like the other kimpton properties, it's a classic old hotel that's been beautifully updated. i found the staff to be cordial, and i really like their corporate culture. they're pet-friendly (although i wasn't travelling with the dog), i got a recycling bin in my room, aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals. the rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a hilton. what the allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. ok, they may be a little pricey, but i'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily.
deceptive	"hotel monaco is simply amazing. i travel quite a bit, and am use to generic hotels, with horribly unimpressive rooms, and ""5 star amenities"" which usually mean a packet of instant coffee, and room service that won't serve after 9pm. hotel monaco on the other hand was very impressive. the suite i stayed in was stylish and cozy. this hotel has such personality. my absolute favorite part of my stay, aside from the amazing meal i had down stairs, was the in-room spa treatment. hotel monaco just raised the bar on hotels for me. generic just won't do anymore."
deceptive	we were hungry and tired when we checked into the chicago sheraton. the nice clerk at the front desk got us checked in efficiently and with a warm smile. he made us dinner reservations at shula's (giving us time to shower and change) and arranged for a bellhop to take our bags up to the room for us - what service!! we enjoyed our steaks and the bottle of wine that was recommended by the waiter at shula's - truly a lovely meal. when we returned to our room we were delighted to find that the towels had been replenished and the bed turned down! we enjoyed the view from our room before turning in and having a very restful night's sleep in an incredibly comfortable bed. kudos to the chicago sheraton for getting everything just right!
deceptive	"wow! loved the ambassador east hotel in chicago! it was so close to all the great sights of chicago like navy pier, lake michigan, and all the fabulous dining. the hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional, but cozy manner. the entire family loved it, even the dog...because they are also pet friendly at the ambassador east hotel! we loved the restaurant there, the pump room was great, something to please even the pickiest of our eaters. we were there on a family get-away, but asked to see a larger ""suite"". the suites were gorgeous. i can't wait to tell our friends about this place! our next business trip to chicago, we are booking at this hotel. they have the perfect conference rooms and we love the service! we are definitely coming back!"
truthful	i just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the swissotel chicago. a friend of mine booked it and got a great rate. cheaper than even a fleabag motel. so keep an eye out for specials. the view was great, the location was prime. the staff was helpful. the room was large (we had 2 double beds). i only have one complaint. our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees (i think) would sneak off to talk on the phone. the sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day. fortunately, the sound was only in the bathroom so it wasn't like it kept us up at night. it was just a little weird. overall, a great stay and i will definitely stay there again.
deceptive	this is an absolutely exquisite hotel, at a great location, and boasting superb amenities. i was here on a personal trip and really enjoyed being so close to the shopping on michigan ave. the hotel itself has a pleasant ambiance and the staff made me feel welcome and quickly responded to my requests for various items from the front desk. i appreciated the homey, well-designed interior and views of the city. it was also nice to have good food at my disposal late night so i didn't have to wander the city for my late night meal. this will definitely be my hotel of choice when i return to the city.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the hyatt regency while attending a family wedding in chicago. from the moment we entered the beautiful lobby we were treated as if we were returning friends. our rooms were ready upon arrival, and they were just as impressive as when i viewed them online. the location couldn't be more convenient to access all of chicago's shopping and dining areas. we dined in seston's chop house, which i highly recommend. the staff at the hotel are professionals who work to make your stay there a grand experience. the hyatt regency chicago is the only place we will stay when we return to the windy city!
truthful	i was scheduled to stay at the hard rock in june, but had to cancel. i had booked the hotel back in january. when i called six days before my arrival date to cancel, i was told that i would be charged for my stay because i did not cancel seven days in advance. i told the customer service rep that i had never heard of such a practice, but she said, in a very smug manner, that i was told back in january. i honestly don't remember being told of the cancellation policy, but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel. i, for one, will never stay at a hard rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice.
truthful	we were at the hotel allegro for an industry analyst event. i could not have expected worse. at first glance, you figured it couldn't be too bad as a kimpton. the unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent. however, the rooms just sucked. imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size. cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size. the building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell. the bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college. the paints peeling on the base boards, the carpet is new, but something is wrong. i would stay at the marriott, renaissance, westin, or any where else.
truthful	we stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a jr suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end. bad cheap furniture, carpet that stops short of reaching the wall, a tv that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew. bad bad experience. find aother hotel plenty in the area.
deceptive	excellent hotel in the heart of chicago. the room we stayed in had a great view of lake michigan. we went in july for a vacation and everything is easily accesible from the hotel. most major attractions are in around the loop area. we also got a great deal on the price. i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago - its in the right spot for both business and pleasure.
truthful	if you're in chicago and want to stay in the loop, the allegro hotel is perfect for you. it's centrally located, stylish rooms and attentive staff. i stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was very pleased with everything. the bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows, large flat screen tv, radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean. everyone that i came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. my last day there, i ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time, the kitchen called to see if everything was alright. i have never had that kind of follow up service. i've stayed at the palomar in dc, another kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too. i will definitely see if kimpton has a hotel at my next destination.
deceptive	this was my first time in chicago and i tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. i took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. i made my way up to my room, which was spectacularly bright and well-lit, then i ordered some food. all in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. if i didn't have such a short stay in chicago i would have stayed in my hotel room all day!
deceptive	"for starters, i had trouble reaching the front desk. every time i called it would ring endlessly! when finally i did reach someone, she was snooty, impolite, and altogether unhelpful. being from the south and not knowing anything about chicago i was hoping the staff would have been more helpful in guiding me around such a large metropolitan area. as i was there on business, i was really looking forward to the wi-fi access so that my business activity would go uninterrupted. unfortunately, this was not the case. after multiple log in attempts i ended up going to a local ""internet bar."" as attractive as the rooms and the hotel itself were, the complete and utter lack of service and delivering up to expectations was disappointing."
truthful	other reviews complain about the small rooms. for a major city, we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings. one feature we liked is the ability to open the window. the knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off michigan avenue in the best area of chicago. the staff was friendly and helpful. for the $116 we paid on hotwire, we could not have found a better room in downtown chicago.
deceptive	i was really excited when we booked a night at the hard rock hotel in chicago. it was actually beyond our budget, but my husband and i needed a weekend away, so i decided to splurge for the occasion. worst waste of my money ever!!! our room was smaller than pictured online, and it looked like the maid didn't vacuum the carpet! we visited the hotel restaurant, angels and kings, one night for dinner and the drinks were overpriced and my husband's steak was cooked wrong (he ordered medium, but received a well-done steak). by the end of our trip we were so glad to leave, but they were under-staffed and the sunday morning checkout line was so long that we waited in line for 30 minutes until we could check out. chicago was a fun city, but next time we return i'll be choosing a different hotel - and i suggest you do too!!
deceptive	i stayed here with my family when we were in chicago on a family vacation. all i can say is wow! a fantastic experience all around. first off, the hotel is magnificent, the lobby/entreway is jaw dropping to say the least. everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks, to the cleaning staff, to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly. the rooms themselves are fantastic, perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation. the new serenity beds that the hilton offered were to die for! one of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years! the kids loved the ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and i loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours. as usual, it had wifi, which was ultra cheap and very very fast. over all i highly recommend the palmer house hilton!
truthful	the hotel is staffed by very nice but many inexperienced people. executive lounge has limited hours and no access outside of those hours. other areas similarly lack the level of service that is expected for this type of hotel. one of the individuals at the concierge desk twice gave us bad information about public transportation and the hours at one place. while the location is good, this particular hotel is simply not a good representation of what swissotel is supposed to be, and there are far better choices in chicago. it would not be my choice for a return stay.
truthful	as i sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel allegro, i listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left. she seems to have a cough today. in the room on my right, someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit. i hear the water running and the toilet flushing. i also hear footsteps in the room upstairs. even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms. i've stayed in about a dozen kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst. the room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains, the curtains with a large brown stain (i don't want to guess what it is), paint peeling, rips in the wallpaper. the decor is a bit garish, with pepto-bismol covered walls, green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet. the size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable, but i'm so glad i had earplugs to avoid listening to others' toilets flushing all night. the location is good for downtown theaters or business. only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly. chicago has many nice hotel options -- many i've enjoyed quite a bit. unfortunately this is not one of them, and even more unfortunate for me: i'm stuck here for two more nights. i was looking forward to staying here because most kimptons are hip, comfortable and attractive. this is not.
truthful	from the moment i stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began! i enjoyed every minute @ the fairmont! the king room was spacious and the decor chic! the coffee maker was the coolest and the bathroom is huge! i really like the separate shower, tub, and separate door for the toilet. the desserts and cheese spread at eno so yummy. before the fairmont the w hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at.
truthful	if location is the only thing that matters, stay at the talbott. however, my wife and i have travelled extensively throughout north america and europe, and i have never, in my entire life, seen such an inept housekeeping staff. they are unprofessional, noisy, incompetent and better suited for a one star hotel. they were yelling in the halls, slamming doors, and taking far too long to clean each room. they come to your room several times to check the fridge where they sell bottles of water for $3. the hotel was being renovated when we were staying there so we also had to endure the construction work - no discount was offered even after we complained several times. the front desk staff was very polite, but who cares?they're supposed to be nice. i spent a lot of money to stay here and did not feel that i received a fair deal. the room was sub-par for the price, even for an inner city hotel. stay somewhere else and have a better vacation.
deceptive	what was supposed to be a fun weekend getaway with the girls in chicago turned into a complete disaster. the first problem arose when we arrived at the airport and the car the hotel concierge was supposed to arrange to pick up our group of 6 was a small town car there was no chance we could all fit in...they knew we had 6! we ended up just getting a taxi van to take us all to the hotel. when we arrived they had our three rooms spread out on 3 different floors despite our request for rooms near each other. after some finagling they were finally able to get us in 3 rooms on the same floor, unfortunately one of the rooms hadn't even been cleaned which meant more waiting around. the staff never seemed to have any sense of urgency when we voiced our concerns nor did they offer any apologies for the inconveniences they were creating. on our second morning we were woken up by a loud noise that sounded like funriture being rearranged in the room above us at 5:30am. despite my calls to the front desk, the sound seemed to continue for about 45 minutes. we also didn't know the hotel was sooo pet friendly. one morning we woke up to find a huge dog turd just outside the room door. i understand they allow pets, but really...people need to clean up after their animals...or have some dog free floors. while hard rock hotel in chicago may be beautifully decorated and offer some great rooms, their service was terrible, the staff was rude, and i still can't get over that dog poo in the hallway. i definitely won't be staying here again.
deceptive	the james chicago is a stuffy, uninviting hotel. if you are looking for all of the comforts of home, do not stay here. the rooms are like boardrooms,not bedrooms. definitely not a child-friendly hotel. the restaurant on site is also very modern and screams pretentious. i would not vacation here again, especially not with children. they were afraid to touch anything in the whole hotel!
deceptive	the palmer house hlton hotel has to be the nicest hotel i have stayed at in chicago. i went to chicago on a business trip for a meeting. when i arrived once i walked in, the lobby was beautiful, i couldn't hardly wait to see my room. the rooms were just as nice, the bathroom was immaculate! we had a meeting in the clark meeting room, even that was nice! i wanted to take a tour of the hotel itself! i was there for about 3 days and because of how convenient the hotel was to a lot of major attractions like, grant park, lake michigan, mag mile which is a shopping heaven, and the navy pier, it never really like the normal stressed out meetings. i love chicago and i now have a new favorite hotel to stay at while i'm in town.
deceptive	the hard rock hotel chicago is great alternative to ordinary hotels. the hotel is decorated with a huge variety of music memorabilia that makes the stay worth it alone. the hotel is often visited by many talented artists including singers, dancers,actors etc. the staff were very polite and helpful and always pleasant. the rooms were very clean and nicely decorated, as were the common areas and hallways. i would highly recommend the hotel to anyone staying in the area.
deceptive	great hotel! the staff is friendly, corteous, and professional. they made me feel like i was a returning guest which i was not (but i will be!). the rooms were very clean and i slept well in the comfy bed. they have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that i took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside. my only issue was the battery for the tv remote died. however, a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about 2 minutes! 5 stars!!!
truthful	i travel to chicago quite often, and have stayed at a bunch of hotels. i stayed at conrad a couple of times. my impression was not too good. both times the receptionist was quite cold and i didn't feel welcome at all. the room was noisy. thin walls, and you could hear exactly what the next room is talking about. one time the tv was broken too, and a guy came in and took like an hour to fix it... anyway, given that this is a 4.5 star hotel, it really didnt live up to my expectations. after the 1st time at this hotel, i thought i might give it a second try. after the 2nd time, i decided i am really not coming back, especially given that there are so many other hotels close by. the other attendees of our conferences were also complaining about the hotel. so i guess i am not alone in this...
deceptive	"this place was absolutely foul. from the minute i walked in, i knew making a reservation here was a mistake. the person at the counter would barely make eye contact with me and acted like i was asking a huge favor of them in order to check in. the room we requested (a room with double beds) was not available. they told me that when i made the reservation, requesting double beds was a ""request"" and not a ""guarantee."" what's the point of making a reservation, then? when we got to the room, the room was totally gross. the decor was dated, the carpet was torn in spots and the whole place smelled musty and almost moldy. the bathroom had spots and stains all over it. i hesitate to think of the true cleanliness of the sheets. the ""complimentary"" fitness area was a joke. one broken treadmill and a couple of mismatched dumbbells. thanks but no thanks. we will definitely not return."
deceptive	we stayed for two nights for a meeting. it is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean. the service was very good, as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable. the rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses. the restaurant has good seafood, but was a bit expensive. we would come back again.
deceptive	i took my family to the affinia chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous. my kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by. my wife was really stoked with spaffina. the pampering and really made her feel special. and they are very attentive to pets also. my dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention.the hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels, so their stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also. my favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content, which left me free to go over to underground wonderbar for a nice cocktail.
deceptive	a hotel made for royalty. decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of, it is an amazing experience! it's located right in the middle of everything in chicago, and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience. the customer service was fantastic, as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own. a beautiful experience that i would certainly do again!
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago, il, and boy was i surprised. the hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious. in fact, the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating. as if this were not enough, the bathroom of my room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the ""fresh"" towels. towards the end of my stay i saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls."
truthful	"let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis (not including our business travel). we've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail. we were not at all impressed by this hotel. at $220/night we were expecting a decent, clean hotel but obviously not a 5*. we were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given (1546). the paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling, there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room, the internet service was extremely slow, the toilet ran throughout the night, and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in. we told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was ""i know, we can't wait for our renovations."" if it hadn't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the uk & booked into this hotel by a travel agent, we would have checked out as soon as we checked in. let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow. all we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff. in its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation. despite its location i cannot understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience. we would never book at this hotel again."
truthful	"i have stayed in hotels all over the world, and this is probably the worst service that i've ever experienced. the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would. i decided to try the monaco because it seemed interesting, was close to the theater, and had what seemed to be a good rate. what a huge mistake. the front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful. the room was not clean, the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving, they never bothered to come turn down the beds, and the late check-out ""priviledges"" which were guarenteed when i booked the room suddenly became ""upon request"" - boy the extra 30 minutes they gave me sure were helpful. dont' waste your time or your money here. at best, it's nothing special. personally, i like the fairmont in chicago, but anyplace woudl be better than the monaco."
truthful	stayed here on business a few nights and really liked it. very attractive, classy and comfortable hotel that's got an element of sexy and sharp. public spaces are very nice, with an open area bar in the front lobby and nice sitting areas. rooms are lovely as well, with handsome fixtures and furniture, a terrific desk work space and comfortable bed. bathroom amenities and fixtures are sleek and attractive as well. best of all, the hotel has breathtaking views of the city and the water - both the river and the lake. if you're working in the area, it's the best choice for that part of town, and i prefer it to the nearby hyatt and monaco.
truthful	i stayed here 2 nights for a business conference. the food was pretty good. and they had these really good mints that i couldn't resist. the room was very comfortable and the bed was great. but i was annoyed by many issues. first, their internet went down for a couple of hour when i was there on a break from the conference. it wouldn't have been big deal except i needed to do some business while it was down. second, the internet wasn't available in the conference rooms. i suppose the conference i attended would have had to pay extra for it. third, the chair in the room was too low for the desk so i was in an awkward position while using my computer which gave me a back ache later. fourth, on the second night my key didn't work. so i asked for a new one which also didn't work. so i asked for another one and the same thing happened. thankfully the front desk asked a security guy to meet me up at my room so i didn't have to go back down to the lobby a third time. then he came back a little later to tell me i was in the wrong room, which i wasn't. finally, he came back with the right key. fifth, the tv had one remote control for changing the channels and a different one for the volume. sixth, they didn't have the comedy channel. much cheaper hotels do. if this hotel didn't cost so much money all of these things would be minor inconveniences, but i would expect more for what i paid.
truthful	"i was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late september, and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle, but affected me and my husband. for example, he got locked out of our room 2 times, once having to wait for 15 minutes in the hallway after going to the spa. the other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony, so that was stressful because he lost some time. the keycard just would stop working. then a fuse blew, so we had no power while trying to get ready. it happened to me also, coming back from the spa, and i called on the hallway phone to get help. luckily, right after that, an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if i had been waiting long--as if she knew this was a problem. i said no, and she called down to check. apparently, no one had even called security to get me back into my room! she had a set of keys and let me in, thank god. then, on our wedding night, my husband wanted to order from room service. it was a little after 10:30pm. we were told that room service was closed for the night--even though all the literature in the room brags about ""24 hour dining."" that fact was never communicated to us when we checked in. i feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping. we later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off, so maybe that's why people weren't too intersted in providing good service. i don't think if i would recommend that anyone stay at this fairmont nor will i ever again. btw, the spa is great to hang out in, even if you're not doing a massage."
deceptive	upon entering my hotel room at the palmer house hilton i immediately turned my nose up at a foul odor coming from the bathroom. after placing my bags on a poorly made bed i walked into the bathroom to find the last visitor had failed to flush the toilet. i immediately called room service and asked for a new room. they apologetically told me there were no other rooms available but would send someone right up to handle the mess. after oh around a half hour of waiting a very angry maid knocked at my door. she seemed very irritated to have to deal with the mess and looked at me as if i should have been the one dealing with it. after the room was cleaned up she turned to me as if asking for a tip. i hesitated and she angrily stormed out of the room. i thought things would run smoother and tried to relax with an ipod. yes you can use your ipod in the room however what they fail to mention is the constant white noise because the signals are so poor. and nothing could compare to the remote control heating and air. when i was able to get the buttons on the remote to work the temperature seemed to change on its own. if i wanted hot air it would slowly get colder and vise versa. after giving up on a nice television program i decided to retire to bed. egyptian sheets? right! all i can say is i found myself early to check out and in a new hotel within the next hour. if you value your back do not rent a room from this hotel.
deceptive	"my stay at the palmer house hilton was less than satisfactory. i would have expected much for from such a ""high end"" hotel. the rooms were way over priced, and the service was less than satisfactory. at one point, i left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up, and when room service came through, they were still there! on the other side of things, the cup i had left on my desk (which i was planning to use later) was gone. my coffee and my towels were also never replaced. i also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room. rather, it was a ""nominal fee"". after paying so much for a room, i had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi. my stay at the palmer house hilton left much to be wished for. i will not be staying there again."
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the palmer house hilton last month to celebrate our anniversary. what a wonderful hotel!! we had such a great weekend, largely thanks to the palmer house. every amenity we could want was right there at the hotel, at our fingertips. and the location is perfect--right in downtown chicago. we stayed in one of their one bedroom king suites. it was exquisite--so elegant and beautiful. it was easily the most luxurious suite we have ever stayed in. the service was impeccable. every employee we encountered was both pleasant and eager to accomodate any need we expressed. we had our anniversary dinner at the lockwood restaurant in the hotel. it was delicious! we will definitely return to the palmer house hilton for our next special weekend getaway.
deceptive	we enjoyed our stay at the james in chicago very much. the hotel is elegant and uber-modern! each room simply exudes class. i have never stayed in a nicer hotel, to be honest. the hotel features an upscale restaurant, though it is within walking distance of many great dining establishments. there is also a full-service spa at the hotel. the most surprising thing about the james is that pets are allowed; our dog didn't have to stay at home. how cool is that? there are also lots of up-scale amenities like valet parking, 24-hour room service, 24-hour concierge, shoe shine service, and laundry/dry cleaning. the hotel is located right on the magnificent mile, so that location is absolutely superb. you are literally steps away from some of the best dining and shopping in the world. i would recommend the james to anyone on business or looking to stay in upscale luxury on a jaunt to chicago.
deceptive	from the moment i stepped into the ambassador east hotel, i was very much impressed!! the entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant. the bell staff escorted my husband and i right up to our suite. our suite was beyond belief. the atmosphere was very classy and romantic. my husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived. we had traveled to chicago, from new york, for a romantic weekend get away. we had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant, the pump house, and were very pleased. dinner started with soup and a salad, main course meal and dessert, all for a reasonable price. we did a little local shopping the next day, after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds. every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience. we enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the ambassador east hotel the next time that we are in chicago, illinois. 5 stars....
truthful	named my price on priceline. $50.00 bucks. hotel room was great. clean, clean and new. fresh crisp sheets, comfortable bed, flat screen tv, clean carpet, nice bath, etc. short distance to food and sightseeing. i highly recommend this property. be prepared to pay over $40.00 per night to park. hey, its a hyatt. they also charge $5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck. for a total of $100.00 nightly stay in chicago this place is it just don't drink the bottled water. happy travels
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. the hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive. the concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay, and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do. we were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. the decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood. the bar and lounge areas had excellent service, and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown chicago. additionally, my husband and i were extra pleased to learn that because we are aaa members, we would be receiving 20% off our room rate for the weekend. overall, the amenities and experience of staying at the hotel allegro chicago made us feel like movie stars, pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment, one in which we would definitely choose to stay again.
deceptive	your website wowed me enough to book online although i had never used your hotel. i had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to chicago and i was very disappointed. the first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk. we had to wait a long time to get checked in. when we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom. the maid hadn't finished the room and she'd left her stuff behind! of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle. the next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one. we knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled, non barking pets. this animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep. i called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped. i think the dog just gave up because it didn't sound like the desk staff knew what to do. the crowning disaster, at least for my kids and husband, was that the remote control for the tv was dead. we managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake. your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great. i cannot recommend it to anyone.
deceptive	we decided to spend a little extra to stay at this hotel while visiting our son in chicago. won't make that mistake again. the rooms are smaller than they appear on the web (creative photography) and the place is dirty.we've stayed at best westerns that are cleaner! the air conditioner is super loud ... and the walls are paper thin. the people in the next room must have been having a party and despite three calls to the front desk between 1 and 3 a.m., security failed to stop the ruckus. also thought the front desk staff was rude. usually in hyatts, hiltons, etc., the staff is polite and tries to be accommodating. these people weren't particularly personable ... we seemed to be an interruption of their work rather than the reason for it. the only positive about the hotel was the location -- but that doesn't make up for the negative experience. save some money and stay somewhere else!
truthful	after some deliberation i booked the sofitel water tower place for a 3 night stop-over in june. this was my first visit to chicago and it turned out that we had a really great time. we loved our rooms, which were just the basic type on the lower floors but they were very well appointed. the decor is modern and personally i liked it a lot. the rooms were pleasant and airy and the bed extremely comfortable. the hotel location is just perfect, close to the shops on michagan avenue, and the beach at oak street. lovely restaurants close by and nightlife in rush street is just steps away. the area although bustling was peaceful and quiet. we could walk to most places and i would not hesitate to stay here again. the hotel staff very helpful, always smiling and ready to help; from the doormen to the helpful lady at conceriage. i would not hesitate at all to stay at sofitel water tower place next time i'm in chicago; in fact i look forward to my next visit.
truthful	i stayed here august 20 through 23rd with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel. the price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on michigan avenue. the front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities. the john entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch. any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and the hard rock hotel in chicago really helped me accomplish just that!
truthful	awesome hotel, our room overlooked michigan ave and we could see the river. very stylish, trendy room and hotel. lacked a bit in amenities (pool, etc) but more than made up for it with the location and quality of the hotel. booked it thought hotwire for $99 which was awesome value.
deceptive	first let me say wonderful!! my wife and i were refered this hotel by a friend. after traveling to chicago many time we have had many experiences good and bad with different hotels. we were amazed with the knickerbocker, we felt like royalty from our first step on the property. everyone was willing to make our stay rememberable. this hotel made a routine trip to chicago a dream vacation. i can not wait to return...
truthful	the swissotel is totally understaffed and lacking any charm or atmosphere. it was clean, comfortable and had great views but if you wanted to check-in, use the concierge, check-out, or report a problem to the front desk, forget about it. i booked this place through priceline.com so i can't complain too much as i didn't pay a lot for the room but i have stayed at 4 star hotels in the past as well as another swissotel. it left a lot to be desired. the minibar fridge in my room didn't work so forget about a cold beer. also, the internet/movie/guest services console didn't work so i had to go to the business office to access the internet. when it was time to checkout the console still wasn't working. it's better than the holiday inn but way below expectations for a 4 star hotel
deceptive	for a hotel that touts its luxury location in chicago the talbot is very poor (think motel 6 at a hilton price). carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin. they are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks, so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of. for the prices they charge ($350.average price for two people). it seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby, which was happening while i stayed, could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms. but i guess the talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests, which i won't be.
truthful	we stayed at the conrad for only one evening but it was such an amazing room we would have liked to stay longer! we were on the newly renovated 9th floor and the room was gorgeous and super clean! there was a flat screen, bose sound system and even an ihome for our ipod. wireless was free and they bring you a free bottle of water at turn down. everyone was very helpful and so friendly. we can't wait to go back again!
truthful	i stayed at the omni with a band that what in town. the room was amazing. just walking in, the hotel was gorgeous. i have no complaints. prompt room service, friendly front desk. many shops, beautiful fountin. just an all around great hotel in a great city.
deceptive	"i selected the talbott for my recent family vacation to chicago. we chose the hotel for it's close proximity to navy pier and otherwise central location. in retrospect, the phrase ""location, location, location"" apparently does not apply to hotels. it's a good thing the location was so great, because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad. upon our arrival, our room was not ready. the clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation, and told us simply that ""we would have to wait"" without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready. when we finally arrived in the room, the sheets were not clean. a call to housekeeping proved difficult, as i do not speak spanish. the second day of our trip, housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our ""please service"" sign hung on the door. we stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on michigan ave. when the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order, it was cold and not very good. despite these poor impressions, the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout. my call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in mumbai. they will not receive my business again."
deceptive	"my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium hotel was a short one; although, it was intended to be for five days, it only last two. when me and my husband arrived we were met by a valet who knicked our mercedez. the clerk/concierge was on his phone for nearly 5 full minutes before he noticed that we were standing in front of him. when we checked in, we lugged all of our luggage upstairs to our room to find that someone was already in it. we then returned to lobby, and to our dismay, the hotel had double booked the room! after another 30 minutes of haggling and whatnot we were able to be moved to a ""better"" room. the bed was unbearable, the shower looked like it hadnt been cleaned properly and the room smelled of cigarrettes (although it was supposedly a non-smoking room). too tired and jet lagged to complain we went to sleep. however, it was hard for us to do so because voices could be heard all thoughout the night due to the paper thin walls of the room. i needed an ambien to go to sleep. i woke up with backaches, the continental breakfast had me in the bathroom most of the day, and the maids conveniently forgot to clean our room. me and my husband had had enough and decided to go to the hyatt."
truthful	great, awesome service. seriously, the people are amazing. that, and the nice bartender who serves after last call (at least, that's what i was told - i of course don't drink) save this place from one star. but seriously blah, small, non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $725/night, even in a major city, the rooms better be awesome. i've had waaaay better rooms in nyc for $350/night. (good thing i had a corporate rate.) and my room was not especially big, despite what the below reviews say. but here's the main problem. even on the 10th floor, the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6, and 6:15, and 6:30, and 6:45, and 6:50, and 6:55, and...and, well, i finally got up and said screw it, let's greet the day. maybe everyone else was already up, but somehow i doubt it. am now safely ensconced in the four seasons.
truthful	"we stayed at the ritz carlton two weeks prior, and in comparison the sofitel does not come close. with the deal the ritz carlton is putting on right now, stay two nights...get one free, choose the nicer option! pros: room service: quick! 15 minutes tops. bathroom: large bathroom with a separate shower and tub. lobby: very impressive, and the doormen are on top of opening the doors and hailing a cab for you. location: close to the train station and mi ave. cons: no top sheet! we asked the others at the conference, they confirmed...there is no top sheet. you just sleep with the duvet cover over you. room: -small, and not a fan of the modern decor. -broken closet door, the bottom track was bent. by the last day my husband removed the closet door completely so i could get to my things. -barely any storage: closet was teeny tiny anyways, almost no bigger than a tall locker, only the top drawers of the nightstands open. -shower: horrible water pressure. -the cleaning staff did not replace shampoo, soap, etc. had to call the front desk, and they delivered within 10 mins. -the cleaning staff did not replace our duvet cover during the three nights we were there, realized this as i still noticed a stain we made the first night. i made sure not to leave the ""save the water"" card out. they changed our towels, but not the bedding??? -our room was at the end of the hall across from where the staff enter, and you could heard that door slam shut all hours of the day. -they charge for wi-fi! -you can change the settings on the tv...brightness, etc."
deceptive	i just spent the weekend here with my wife, and she loved it as much as i do. i was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients, so i didn't have any choice. but when my wife said she wanted to come to chicago, i knew this was the place to take her. the hotel hasn't just been remodeled, it's been completely redesigned. things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better, and the two rooms that i've seen are showplaces. they are amazing. this hotel is part of a luxury chain, and it's easy to see why. they offer full room service at convenient hours. i've been in every eating area now, and they are all great, too. whether for business or pleasure, you can't beat this. it's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you'd expect. my wife was stunned, and yours will be, too.
deceptive	great hotel with beautiful scenery! the staff was wonderful and the rooms were comfortable and spacious. they even had a docking station for my ipod!
truthful	i stayed at the sheraton as it was where a conference i was attending was being held. on the plus side, the hotel is reasonably well located, within a few minutes walk of michigan avenue. my room had a superb view out over the river. however, for the price i must say that the room look decidedly shabby and worn and is in need of refurbishment. the decor was dated, and my bathroom unit was cracked and the shower rail rusty. the wifi is ridiculously expensive, and frustratingly as a conference delegate i was unable to use the service downstairs in the venue despite having paid for 24 hours access. there was no wifi in the conference rooms, although it was free in the lobby area should you wish to sit there and do your emails. i know chicago is expensive, but for that price i feel the experience should have been better.
deceptive	james chicago; the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised. i didn't want stay in this hotel, but my wife insisted. ok, so when i booked the ticket, it cost me $299 for one room. $299! i could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point! the room was stylish though, it looked nice. there was a tv, and the beds were fine. although i couldn't quite understand why they had wifi and no computer. why would i even need wifi if there is no computer? what were they thinking!? the experience i had with james chicago was a bit below of what i had expected. i mean the food available there wasn't very tasty at all. i had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and i was also hoping to browse the internet, but they had no computer, only wifi. that's like only having bread, without any fillings to make it into a sandwich!
truthful	stayed here for one night in june, but have stayed here before when on business in chicago. great location for business/shopping/sightseeing. in between michigan avenue's magnificent mile and the loop and next to the chicago river. rooms very spacious and clean. gym has a wonderful view, as it is situated on the top of the hotel. bar next to lobby, very busy with good atmosphere. cannot fault the hotel. prefer it to the westin - my previous address when in chicago.
deceptive	"my wife and i were guests at the hotel allego in chicago for a long weekend getaway (september 2 - 5, 2011). we had checked out the hotel's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip. once we arrived, the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy. when i asked to be moved to another room (my wife has asthma) we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time. the room was not particularly well-cleaned: we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor, and a film of dust across the television set. we are not the type to complain, so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. at nighttime when we tried to sleep, we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin, every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly. we were tossing and turning half the night. in the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day, but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated: a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. the concierge was almost never around in the lobby (her sign always said ""be right back!"") and when we did ask her questions, she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. the second night was without incident, luckily, except for the terrible bed, but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our ""do not disturb"" sign. i would not recommend this hotel."
truthful	"i've been here for 4 days. great location right off of miracle mile, near all major hotels, best shopping and theatres. rooms very large. hotel staff very friendly and helpful, and respond immediately. problems: there frequently are homeless people (even during daylight) on superior between st. clair and michigan avenue (the main route you walk for or all activities, and just about everything is in walking distance from here). at night, the street on the north side of superior is dark, and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors. the street people do not approach you, although they may stare as you go by. usually 2 or more along the way, where they sleep on the window sills of neiman marcus. i would not think a woman would feel safe by herself. (i am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia.) there are homeless up and down michigan street, but this is different as it's a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street. the entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work, and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation. for now, expect two extremely small, warm, slow elevators with long waits serving 17 floors and warm, cramped hallways! all the walls throughout the hotel need painting, and the wallpaper is peeling in places. in the room, several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection, the carpets were stained, the bathrooms needed new grout (some mold visible), the tv is very small (16 inch?) and the windows very, very dirty. you won't get your room serviced unless you ask for it, sometimes more than once. the ""pub "" downstairs is run down, dark and kind of creepy. food and room service are very expensive, as is parking ($34/day public and $38/day valet). on the plus side, the bed was very comfortable, there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area, plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans st. clair street toward the north and south. you can see a sliver of lake michigan. pool small, but clean. all in all, it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room, but i think it is overpriced, and i would not stay here again."
truthful	we paid $75 a night through priceline, which is excellent for june. our room had a fantastic view of the hancock building and the river. the room was large, clean and had a couch, easy chair and desk chair. the bedding was the newer 'non-bedspread' style, the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was large and, well, we were pleased with the room and the hyatt in every way. we ate at the lobby restaurant, which is attractively decorated and was bustling with activity when we were there. we only got cobb salads, so i don't know if the food, in general, is good or not. the cobb was so-so. our only complaint was the $48 fee to park your car over-night and the $13 daily fee for the internet. many places are offering free internet these days and i wish the hyatt would hop on board with this concept. we hated to leave!
truthful	we planned to stay for 5 nights on a family trip. i booked this hotel because of the expected value for a suite as well as the free breakfast - get a quick bite, then head out for the day to do normal tourist stuff. well, our stay here lasted 1 night and we quickly, and thankfully, switched to a different hotel for our last 4 nights. the room was dirty. when we opened the sofabed, the sheets were filthy and there was a mess of dirt and crumbs that fell out. ridiculous considering this is a suite hotel where the sofabeds are likely used, and theoretically cleaned, a lot. extra blankets were also dirty and bathrooms weren't much better. temperature control in the room was imprecise - minor inconvenience but without clean blankets on our only night, it made for a cold stay. if you like to eat for free (they have free breakfasts and dinner on certain nights) and don't care to eat the great food chicago has to offer, i guess some may find this place tolerable. but we found the buffet no better than average and felt like we were at a golden corral. the only thing this hotel really has going for it is location but there are other options in this area (we switched to the james and had a great experience). i couldn't be paid to stay here again. i'm shocked by the high overall rating given our experience.
truthful	we booked this hotel as a last minute vacation planned on doing a little shopping and nightlife downtown. we where woken up at 6:00 in the morning with our bathroom flooded, this water was brown and all the clothing and our belongings left in the bathroom were dirty and sopping wet. we where moved to another room, but it was smaller then the orginal room we had gotten and paid for. the next day the housekeeping service never even came to change our sheets, coffee or towels, which is just horrible service. the service along with the orginal room where perfect, but we do not plan on ever spending another weekend in that flooding hotel.
deceptive	my stay at the talbott was a wonderful experience. the service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations, the gold coast location is close to michigan ave, the museums, and many of the other sites chicago has to offer.if you are visiting chicago, i highly recommend the talbott!
deceptive	after staying at the james chicago last weekend i can honestly say i will be going for affordability on my next trip. the james chicago is terribly overpriced and the staff was very cold and disconnected. the chairs in the room looked like something out of ikea. i love chicago but this hotel is definitely not one of its better places to stay. i believe i would have been better off and happier staying at the holiday inn. you don't always get what you pay for.
deceptive	i booked my reservations at the talbott hotel in hopes of finding luxury and excellent service. what i actually got was far less than that. when i first arrived to check in, the woman at the desk was very impolite and looked rather bored. it took her over 5 minutes to even find my reservation in the computer system! and i won't go into detail about how she messed up with my room keys and had to give me a second set! when i finally got to my room, the first thing i noticed was that it smelled stale. the air in the room literally smelled like it had been in that room, without any fresh air, for years. i soon discovered my bathroom toilet had a leak, as well, and every time you flushed the toilet, water would trickle out from the base onto the floor. talk about concerning. i reported this to the desk, and the fellow who answered promised someone would be up right away to fix it. no one showed up until the next day, and very early in the morning, i might add. later, i called room service and asked for a bottle of wine. it took them half an hour to deliver it to my room! and it wasn't even chilled by the time it showed up, either; it was lukewarm. overall, my experience here was not very pleasant, and i don't recommend booking with this hotel.
truthful	the room was big and luxurious, befitting the price tag ($299). bed was very comfortable. however, my bed was against the wall abutting the elevator shaft, and i heard the elevators running all night. also held a one-day conference there for 25 people. they stuck us in a long, narrow room that was cramped. also, the night before we had a pre-conference dinner at the palm restaurant in the hotel. service was so slow that some of our party left before entrees were served. and the steaks were only so-so, a far cry from my experience with other palms.
truthful	stayed at the talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay. room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift, but everything else made up for that. positives: bed was very comfortable, great to have real shower, free internet, gym usage, staff (all friendly) and location. negative: lift noise, lifts slow and restaurant (there are so many great restaurants around - don't bother staying in) would stay again!
truthful	we arrived at 10:30 am on a friday, and they had a room ready for us by 11:30 am, mind you check in is not until 3:00pm. we got our room on priceline for $65.00 per night and stayed 3 nights. we were upgraded - for free - to a suite. i think i was so blown away by that, that i forgot to thank them at check-in! our room was fantastic. it also had a wet bar and a fridge. the bathroom was quite large and had a nice sized closet with many hangers. i knew from previous reviews to not touch the mini-bar. the bed and pillows were very comfortable. the room was very clean. every employee there went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. we stayed on the 25th floor of the east tower and had a quiet room. yes, you could hear people in the hallways, but only because they were rude and were yelling. these were not children, they were adults. i don't know why everyone complains about $48 for parking. this is chicago and every other hotel we saw charged just as much, some without in/out privledges. we didn't use any of the restaurants or the health club. we tried to eat at the corner bakery but it was too crowded. breakfast at nearby houlihan's had a buffet for $9.99 per person. also the grocery store behind the hotel is great. there is a 7-11 not too far away. i don't know why there are so many bad reviews on this hotel. yes, it's a big hotel. if you don't want a busy lobby, don't stay in a 2,000 plus room hotel!! i loved the hotel and would recommend it to anyone. not one problem. wasn't too busy for me. would stay here again in a heartbeat.
deceptive	do you want to stay in a sleek modern hotel that gives you all of the amenities to conduct your business? then the james hotel in chicago is the place for you. superb clean lines and sophistication welcomes you on first sight. followed by spacious rooms, luxurious linens, and all-natural kiehl's body shampoos and lotions. i absolutely loved my stay at the james hotel in downtown chicago. the bathrooms have raised sinks, and all of the luxurious amenities you would want. i absolutely loved the natural wood feel mingled with a modern touch. i felt at home in a very clean and modern atmosphere. i definitely would stay again, and plan to stay at the james in new york as well
truthful	i stayed at the omni for one night following a business meeting at another downtown chicago hotel. i was completely impressed by the service; all personnel during my stay were absolutely outstanding. i checked in quite early (no problem) and was efficiently checked in. my room had a somewhat heavy scent of air freshener (the only negative from the entire stay), which was managed reasonably well by opening the windows. i don't generally require much during my hotel stays, but suffice to say the doorman, housekeeping, the night manager and bartender at 676, the day waiter at 676, and the concierge were amazing - i never waited more than about 30 seconds for anything. the room was very comfy and the amenities were superior. one very tiny complaint - there was no wastebasket near the sink or near the wet bar - had to walk to the other end of the bathroom or sitting room to dispose of kleenex/coffee paraphernalia. one wastebasket would make all the difference. all that said - what a great hotel!! thanks, omni - i had a great stay!
truthful	"i expected a glamorous room and i walked into a disappointment. housekeeping and management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel. if you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesn't go down past 74, the closet is 24"" wide, all old/dirty brass fixtures, beds that are a little bigger than a twin, showerheads that barely put out water, then this is your hotel. i might be spoiled by staying in marriott's, but i stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was severly disappionted. no free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again."
deceptive	i am so glad i decided to stay at the intercontinental chicago for my first trip to the city. the staff is very attentive, i felt like i was the only person they had to take care of! the location is great, right on the magnificent mile and so close to major attractions. my suite was well appointed and very clean. i even looked behind some furniture for dust and couldn't find any. the hotel is very luxurious. the sheets and towels were very soft and the bed very comfortable. the next time i travel to chicago, i will definitely stay at the intercontinental again.
deceptive	this has been one of the most pleasurable hotels ive ever stayed at. from the beautiful concourse to the amazing food, amalfi really exceeds its standards. the in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible. i highly recommend this hotel as i will give my stay a 5/5 stars.
truthful	"overview: --overrated hotel in a premium location. the great: --location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants, bars, and sights. the good: --inviting lobby, pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby, in particular the night deskman. --nice bathroom, comfortable bed and desk chair. the mediocre: --room (excluding bathroom) was underwhelming in design. --no kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from harry caray's across the street. --free cocktails 5-7pm in ""lounge"" is right idea with wrong execution; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door. --hot water (or lack thereof) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm. pressure is pretty low. --view - mine wasn't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible. the bad: --free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day, even when my computer wasn't moved - really aggravating. same deal for my iphone. i also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my norton anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is. --no blackout curtains! i had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning (not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night). never had this issue in any hotel or motel i've ever stayed at. --noise! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling, bar music, trucks, car horns, and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning. i had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor. --tv had crappy hd signal with out of sync audio on every channel. and the remote was useless. --in room bar had standard inflated prices but the $7 bottle of fiji water bedside was insulting. don't even think of opening it; there's a 7-eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost. summary: --not recommended. looks much nicer in the website photos than it is. rating on yelp is bloated by at a least a star."
deceptive	my husband, three year old son and i arrived at the palmer house hilton last friday for a weekend stay. the hotel looked elegant online but included information that also indicated it was child friendly. at the check in the staff was cold and seemed quite annoyed by son who was merely saying hi and asking the name of the person helping us. one elevator was broken we had a long wait for other elevator. the hallway appeared a bit dirty as we made our way to our room. the room was decent. not deluxe as their website indicated it would be but is was comfortable and the view was good. we had a long day of sight seeing and play on saturday. as my son was tired, we elected to return to our room and have room service for dinner. there was no children's menu for room service. only for the restaurant from which the room service came from the same kitchen, what??? we ordered an adult meal. the food arrived an hour later, cold and unappealing. but we at it because we couldn't wait another hour. although the hotel looks lovely. the service was not very good. most of the staff was cold and snooty. except for the cleaning staff who were very nice. it might be ok for a couple or business traveler but do not stay with children. a comfortable motel might be better.
truthful	this hotel was very beautiful. i went with a group of 4 friends and we had a blast. it was very centrally located and was close to all sorts of transportation. the continental breakfast was magnificent! i didn't see much of the staff but all of the men at the front door were extremely helpful.
truthful	we stayed at the sheraton by navy pier the first weekend of november and were very pleased with the accommodations and the service. we were upgraded to club level rooms and stayed in 3114 and 3115 adjoining. the view from both rooms was spectacular (as you can tell from the picture attached). they also left a plate of cookies and treats in the kids room upon check-in which made us all feel very special. the hotel is central to both navy pier and michigan ave. so we walked, trolleyed, and cabbed all around the area. we ate the breakfast buffet both mornings and thought it was pretty good. the eggs were a little runny, but they happily made a different batch for us at the omelet station. our six year old ate free and our two eleven year olds were $14 (instead of the adult $20) the rooms were clean, the concierge & reception staff were both friendly and helpful...we will definitely visit this sheraton again when we're in chicago next time.
deceptive	last week, i booked a 'deluxe suite' at the omni chicago hotel for a weekend stay in chicago. i took the 'retreat and relax' package deal. the wait to check in was intolerably long, because they were letting some people check in with a dog. i'm allergic to dogs, and i'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in. they insisted on escorting me to to my room, every time i came in, like i was going to break into another guest's room or something. i swear, anytime i was out of my room they were watching me like hawks, asking me if i needed anything. you know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you're up to something. i went to the pool, but it was full of screaming children. when i went to bed, i could hear the television in the next room through my wall. and what's worse, they wouldn't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress. they threatened to throw me out on the street, after i gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars! i had to go outside-- probably where the dog went to piddle-- to do it. also, their on-site restaurant is too expensive, given that you're already paying an arm and a leg for the room. the food should be free! i wouldn't stay here again, it was a waste of my money.
truthful	the location of this hotel was excellent as it is just beside the subway and the bus stop for the free trolley bus to navy pier is just beside the hotel. the room was very spacious. kind of too big for a solo traveler. the view from the room was excellent and it was a great view to sleep at night. the bathroom was spacious too and the room has a big wardrobe. the kitchen has microwave oven and cooking utensils. some of the cooking utensils were a bit dirty, probably because they had not been used for sometime. however, the microwave oven was very useful as i can heat up food to eat at night. you can easily walk to the magnificent mile by cutting across the shopping mall across the road. do check out pizzeria uno which is near the hotel that serves the delicious deep dish pizza. for cheaper food, do check out the foodcourt at the shopping mall. the hotel also serves breakfast and dinner from mon to thur. i did not find the food that fantastic but it was pretty decent. i will strongly recommend this hotel to everyone going to chicago.
truthful	first of all, expedia.com charged me for an additional person per my instructions but when i arrived at the hotel these monies were not included and the complimentary breakfast was not offered. the hotel service person who checked us in forgot to give me back my parking ticket but left a generic message for me stating that there was an envelope at the front desk. i had to wait in line for another 20 minutes to discover this the whole time this person was looking at me and never said a word!! i was charged and paid for parking adjacent to the hotel. when we went to leave the gate would not open. we had to find the parking garage office and the manager had to call several times over to the hotel until finally someone picked up. they confirmed my payment and then we were allowed to leave the structure. the hotel itself is beautiful!!! the bell hops and doormen were just wonderful. they were more than helpful and gracious but the internal staff were rude and not helpful at all!!!!
deceptive	i had a business trip coming up in chicago and i wanted to stay someplace really nice, cause i had never been there, so made reservations with the james two weeks in advance just to be on the safe side and when i arrived they had no record of it. no big deal, right? they said they would take care of it and get me a room right away... two hours later i'm still sitting in the lobby! finally i get to my room to try and relax. everything was nice until i decided to take a shower. i went into the bathroom... no towels, wash cloths, nothing. i called down to the front desk and asked for some, about an hour later someone came up with one. maybe they were just really busy? finally i get in the shower and the handle is broken!!! i went down to the front desk and asked for a new room and they started implying that i broke it!!! they said everything was fine with the room earlier that day and that i must have done something to it!!! leaving that hotel was the easiest decision i made on my whole trip. two thumbs down!
truthful	i stayed here for a conference and got the conference rate of $149. i was worried that i wouldn't get a nice room, since it was the weekend before the election and the hotel is across the street from grant park, so it could easily have gotten a lot more for the nicer rooms. i requested a quiet room away from elevators and foot traffic, and that is exactly what i was assigned (perhaps because i am also a 'silver' member?). it was a beautiful room with windows on two sides, a king sized bed. the room was quiet, comfortable and immaculate. the maid even left a thank you note for the tip i had left. all the staff were helpful, polite and cheerful. i appreciated the fact that i could actually purchase a breakfast for under $15 (oatmeal, coffee, and juice)--something not possible at a lot of big hotels, like the hyatt i stayed at last year.
deceptive	i recently stayed at this hotel not to long ago. sure, it looks nice, but it's really just a smoke screen. i went to the clerk to check in and she was very rude to me. i was asking about nearby attractions and she abruptly cut me off to tell me that i need to go find a phone book and ask someone else. she also encoded my key wrong, so i had to have it redone. i finaly get to my room, only to discover it was a mess. the sheets were thrown on the floor, the curtains were wide open and to top it all off, the toliet hadn't been flushed. it was horrible. i called the front desk to have a maid come and fix it up, but i was told they were on break. whatever thoguh, i cleaned up myself. the night progresses and i awaken to the sound of someone beating on my door. some guy said that i was in his room. it baffled me, but we went straight down to the lobby and got it cleared up. they had given his the wrong room. i couldn't take one more day of all the bull. i checked out early the next morning and stayed at a different hotel for the remainder of my visit to chicago. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone.
deceptive	after a one night stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i must say that while i loved chicago i will never go back to this hotel. the problems started in the parking lot, yup before i even got in. there was very little parking available and the area was filled with garbage, broken glass and kids hanging out looking for trouble. upon first entrance the hotel seemed nice but all that changed as we got into the elevator to go up to the room. the elevator made all kinds of noise and the door slammed shut on my arm as i was trying to get the bags out. the hall smelled of smoke and the carpets were warn and dirty looking. when in the room we found that one of the curtains would not pull closed, the heater whistled and when i called the front desk to ask for assistance and fresh pillows i was hung up on. this was only the beginning of our terrible stay. guests where in the hall and banging on walls all night long. the maids started running vacuums before 8 am and seemed to feel that the best way to do it was by hitting the vacuum on the wall with each pass. we could not check out soon enough! we called around and found another hotel to stay in for the remainder of our trip.
deceptive	my fiance and i had taken a trip to chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to downtown, so he chose the amalfi hotel, located conveniently to everything we needed. this place was phenomenal!!! he chose a romantic getaway package, as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever. the hotel is super clean and very chic; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb. we were able to bring along our dog, which was also really important to us. the first day we were there, we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple's massage. the masseuses come straight to your room so it's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great. after our massages, we went to the keefer steakhouse, which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic. they do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the rocket grill, which was nice as well. in all, our 3 nights there were pretty similar, we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there; i've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the windy city.
deceptive	the ambassador east hotel is a pretty girl with a bad heart. as i was staying for a few nights i notied may problems with the service of this expensive,cold hotel.first the room sevice was poorly helpful, the bag boy insisted on a tip, and also droped my bag. the chefs cooking was terriable,the steak that i spent 35 dollars on was suppost to be rare, but came to me burnt. the room was not what you pay for, the beds were like a sack of rocks. and to top it off the covers smelled like smoke. i will never give the ambassador east hotel another chance.
deceptive	my girlfriends and i stayed at the hyatt in chicago during a shopping trip to the city in june 2010. we found a great deal on orbitz.com and decided to give it a try. the location was perfect, just off michigan avenue,on the chicago river, so it was easy to walk down the mag mile and get to all of the shops without having to pay for cabs or rent a car. the hotel is right next the the palm restaurant, and within walking distance of several places to eat, both fancy (china grill, yum!)and affordable (corner bakery). the rooms have been recently remodeled and were clean and spacious. we were lucky to get a room with a good view...be sure to ask that you do not have a view of the office building next door! the lobby is typical hyatt, big and spacious with lots of plants. service was good. all around an excellent experience and a great deal.
truthful	the hotel is just ok. stayed there for 5 days when visiting friends. they had a renovation going so there was no lobby, bar or anything. just a decently furnished room for 200 usd. the renovation was not annoying but i think they ahould charge... much less untill its done. you cant beat the location! very convenient especially if u like chicqgo nightlife!
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel and i could not be more pleased. the hotel is sleek from the elegant lobby to the modern, stylish rooms. the rooms are something truly special with huge, soft beds with the most luxurious sheets you have ever seen and felt. the bathrooms are beautiful with cool marble tiles and a gorgeous glass and marble shower/tub. if that wasn't enough each room has a crisp 32"" lcd tv that displays tv in the most beautiful and clear way with an absolutely amazing sound system. when you finally make it out of your room, down the grand stair case you need not look further for dinner than the hotel restaurant. it is called cafe des architectes and like the hotel itself melds a modern sophistication with classic french techniques. their wine list is amazing but their prices are fantastic for a hotel near the magnificent mile. a full dinner including appetizer, main course, and dessert can be had for $45, amazing. if you are looking for a modern, urban, chic hotel in chicago then look no further, the sofitel chicago water tower hotel is your only real choice."
truthful	we stayed at the hard rock for one night to do some intense, day-after-thanksgiving shopping. it really is a great hotel. the rooms are really cool, and we were just in the basic one. the bed is extremely comfortable, with the softest sheets and great pillows. the technology in the room is great. they have nice upscale tolietries in the bathrooms. for a very modern room, it is still comfortable and homey. the location is perfect for getting wherever you want to go. the staff were very nice and helpful. the bar is really funky with an interesting martini menu. one of the best hotels i have stayed at in chicago. really enjoyed it and would highly recommend.
deceptive	fairmont chicago was a great choice for my wife and i. we couldn't resist the elegant aria restaurant and the accommodations. the room was impeccably clean and the city view was utterly amazing. from the moment we checked in, the staff produced a positive atmosphere with genuine hospitality. my wife even suggested we should have had our wedding reception in their beautiful ball room. overall, i would rate fairmont chicago a 10/10!
truthful	firtly they took $372 off my card, even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night. they had no business taking the money off of my card. so on the 28th sep i contacted them and they admited to the mistake. it is not a month later and i have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back. secondly i booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel. when i looked a week later, they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate, so two of my friends didn't come to the trip away. thirdly i asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken asap as the dollar was weak against the pound. after about 8 phone calls over 5 months (each saying they would) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional ps150. overall, the hotel was nice and in a nice location, but i will never be staying there again due to all my problems.
deceptive	i have to say that the hard rock hotel in chicago is a cool place to stay. when i first got there, getting checked in was very fast. the lady at the counter was nice and well spoken. the bellhop had out bags into the room very fast. the room was very hip and cool. there was musical items all over the place. i really loved the beatles art that was in my bathroom. after being in the room a few minutes, i got a call from the front desk asking me if i liked my room. they also asked me if i would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if i needed to use their business room. i needed some things shipped while i was there, which they had supplies to help me with that. after getting some work done, i called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around. they gave me information for 3 awesome places. i left and came back after having a night out on the town. they were very understanding that i was a wee bit out of it. i had more than pizza that night if you get my drift. when i got back to my room, the bed was so comfortable. i feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep. in the morning i order breakfast, which was really a philly cheese steak. they will make anything you want anytime of day. i checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed. thank you hard rock, you rock!
truthful	staying at this hotel was one of the high points of a last minute, budget valentines weekend trip for my husband and me. we got a great rate -- $70 -- on priceline. close to the subway (red line) and we got from o'hare to the hotel in less than an hour for $3.50 for both of us. we were able to check in more than 4 hours early. room was great -- very clean, good closet space and fantastic bedding. had one expensive drink at the irish bar, but the bartender's advice on restaurants and clubs to check out made it worth the price. concierge was helpful, too. overall, service was terrific, room was great and staying there was a treat. i would stay there again any time, especially at that price.
deceptive	we recently completed our first visit to chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the affinia chicago hotel where we stayed. the hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests, including individual pillow choices, complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit,and fine dining in two on-site restaurants, one of them roof-top with amazing city views. i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago.
truthful	i can see how this place must have been gorgeous at one time but they really need a makeover. 1. there was a huge gaping hole in the carpet on the bedroom floor. i kid you not. how can they have guests in a room where the carpet looks like it had been mauled by a giant earthworm? 2. the furniture was severely chipped. ok. i dont mind chipped furniture if i am slumming it in my just-out-of-college-sister's apartment. but for 170+ a night, i want a room that does not look like it was furnished with stuff retrieved from a dumpster drive 3. the receptionist while i was checking in was super curt. i know it was late but isnt that sort of your job? not everything was horribly bad though. the one star is for the bathroom that was super clean. i do not recommend this place at all.
truthful	my two girlfriends and i arrived at the hotel, and found the hard rock had lost our reservation. i had just called three days before and had confirmed the reservation over the phone. the rude woman at the front desk treated us like we were lying. it wasn't until i started to cause a scene in front of the line of people checking in that she finally decided that she would research the issue. ten minuets later she found our reservation. our room wasn't ready, we were told that it would be ready at noon; we came back at 3 and were told it was still dirty! room was very small. the bathroom shower, sink and floor were filthy. room service trays sit in the hallways all day. the next morning we called down to get towels, they were never brought to the room, we had to drip dry. the only positive experience at the hotel was the concierge christopher. he knew everything about the city and sent us to the perfect nightclub.
truthful	i love the ambassador east, true, she's a little old but she's a classic treasure. the service is wonderful, from the minute you arrive you are greeted warmly and with a nice welcome! i felt the service was good, room was clean and quiet and that all the staff was very accomodating. the biggest gem is the pump room bar and restaurant. the best drinks, amazing food, exciting photographs and fun music on the weekends. this is set in the most fabulous location; historical neightborhood, close to walk the lakefront, well known hometown bars, excellent restaurants chicago has to offer and most of all shopping. there was a nice street market going on over the summer-fall weekends, giving this area a real interesting flavor of chicago. i can see it needs some updating but i was totally happy and content with my stay. i travel a great deal in my work and have seen all kinds of hotels. i will stay here again in the future.
deceptive	i was looking for an unique, hip experience in a hotel that offered the convenient location of downtown chicago. my choice for hotel was obvious: hard rock hotel chicago. if you are wondering whether hard rock hotels are schmaltzy or cliche, they are not. hard rock hotel chicago is modern, trendy and hip. it had an air that this was where musicians came to rock among the 40 stories, and there are details that you won't find elsewhere. for example, one interesting perk is some free itunes downloads (i got ten) for guests. it's a fun place, hosting events such as jack daniel's 160th birthday.
deceptive	the palmer house hilton, while it looks good in pictures, and the outside, is actually a disaster of a hotel. when i went through, the lobby was dirty, my room hadn't been cleaned, and smelled thoroughly of smoke. when i requested more pillows, the lady on the phone scoffed at me and said she'd send them up. it took over an hour for 2 pillows. this hotel is a good example that what you pay for isn't always what you get. i will not be returning.
truthful	"the recently remodeled affina was amazing - from the 6 choice pillow menu to the stocked ""pantry and refrigerator"" to the brand name bathroom ammenities. within walking distance to just about everything you could possibly need, the affina is a great hotel. the staff was pleasant and seemed to enjoy their jobs. having never stayed in downtown chicago before, the affina over and above exceeded our expectations. although our trip to chicago was only for one night, we will consider staying at the affina again for a future visit."
truthful	"this was the 2nd time that we have stayed at the hyatt regency chicago. the first time was far above our expectations for a $69/per night room. the rooms are very nice, and the beds are comfortable. this time we got a great rate through travelzoo @ $104/ night for a room with a view. we were aware of the $41 parking per night. the first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldn't park they were full. we had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over 45 minutes looking at closed parking garages. (it was a saturday evening) finally found a spot and were told that it would be $38. this was 6 blocks from the hotel. mind you its -6 outside and we have luggage to carry too. not very good service for a 5-star hotel. we got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby, its called the harddrive. that's cool and all, yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room, it wasn't an issue. the hvac controls to our room were broken. the first night we were ok, but by the second night it was blazing hot in there, 86 degrees. so hot we couldn't sleep. it was miserable. they sent up the ""engineer"" and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window, 24 floors up. it never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night. it was 5 below that night and the window being open 8"" didn't help. they would not put us in another room either. at checkout, monday morning, our bill came to $240.43 after taxes for the room. we then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for $56.65. cool, i got my reciepts and went on our way. on wednesday i was on my online banking checking my account, to find that hyatt charged me $289.03 and another charge of $103.63!!! that is almost $100 more than what the reciepts from checkout say. i was furious, so i called the hotel. nothing was resolved by my phone call, they treated me as if $100 isn't but something you wipe with. she said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off. that didn't settle well with me, but what could i do. i waited. its friday now. i check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts, and they still have ""authorizations"" on the two incorrect amounts as well. they have charged me an additional $300!!!!!! im so furious! and guess what... hyatt doesn't care. they gave me the same [--] line as they did wednesday. save yourself some hassle and don't stay at this hotel unless you have extra money for them to play with."
deceptive	"i'd expect a ""luxury"" hotel to pay more attention to details. the room really hadn't been thoroughly cleaned-- i found hairballs under the bed, the mirrors were streaked, etc. the desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when i was checking in; three of them, two on the phone, and nobody even made eye contact for 5 minutes. then, they gave the vaguest answers to some pretty basic questions about the neighborhood; you'd think they'd know where to find a starbucks. the internet was ridiculously slow the whole two days i was there."
deceptive	the room was very pretty, and the location is great, but the hotel is so big and they don't have the staff to take care of everything. the heating in our room was loud, making it difficult to sleep. the gym is not big enough, and the hotel parking garage is very expensive. the hotel has so many guests that the lobby was too loud to relax in. we didn't get great service at the hotel bar, and the bar ran out of bar snacks because so many people were in the bar area. later we asked for directions to the restaurant we had dinner reservations at, and the hotel staff we asked did not know how we could get there. the next morning, the cleaning staff tried to get in while we were still in the room.
deceptive	i have to admit, i was a little leery about visiting chicago due to my mild agoraphobia, but after a family member reserved a room at the hotel allegro chicago, my fears were slightly assuaged. a few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before, and had nothing but positive things to say. with this new-found optimism in mind, i went forward on my journey in confidence. i have to say, i was not let down. from the moment i stepped into the lobby, i felt at home. the concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms, and the check-in process was fast and efficient. the rooms themselves are incredibly homey, feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. the high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels, really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in chicago, and provided a secure place to stay at night, or whenever i did not feel like participating with the group. of course, the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. i found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. overall it's very cozy, and has a certain old-world feeling to it, once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. it was never overwhelmingly crowded, and the people i did encounter were incredibly friendly, yet not intrusive. i don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but i love the allegro chicago!
truthful	after staying at the sheraton royal orchid hotel in bangkok, i was expecting a similar experience at the chicago sheraton. i had a wonderful stay at this property seven years ago and was looking forward to a repeat experience. unfortunately, my expectations were not met. for the past 3 years i stayed at the palmer house in the loop, but thought i'd try a more modern hotel. pros - location by the chicago river, two blocks from michigan avenue - restful lobby with river view and free wifi provides a pleasant work environment - buffet breakfast offering custom omelettes, crepes and french toast cons - check-in assigned me to a city view room when i had prepaid for a river view room - river view was good, but the windows to see it were filthy - dirty towel used by the previous guest was still hanging on the back of the bathroom door - bathroom was unimpressive: bathtub-shower combination; worn plumbing fixtures; only 2 sets of towels provided - guest room was small: only one soft chair provided - guest room doors slammed noisily throughout the floor hallway - 7 to 8 block walk to nearest l-station - concierge couldn't explain how to get to the mercury theatre, nor print a map of the area - guest services told me to go out of the hotel one block to get starbucks coffee when it was available downstairs on the link cafe - no complimentary newspaper delivered to the room - no final billing folio delivered to the room on the night before check-out - not all computers were operational at the link cafe where boarding passes can be printed
deceptive	"when i first made reservations at the palmer house hilton, i was excited because of all the gorgeous pictures displayed on their website. little did i know it was going to be a total disaster. first off, my husband and i couldn't find the place. it was our first time in chicago after all. and when i would call for directions, they just kept putting me on hold. when my husband and i finally arrived, the bus boy was extremely rude. after man-handling our luggage, he held his hands out impatiently expecting a tip. talk about arrogant. the front desk clerk was a little too pushy. my husband and i were only staying one night just to attend my sister's wedding, but they kept trying to up-sell a suite when all we needed was a regular guest room. the room itself was okay, decorated so ornately that they are forced to jack up the price and take all that you're worth. they even had the nerve to try and say that we purchased some items from the ""snack bar"" and ordered a movie that i've never even heard of! completely unprofessional. i will never, i repeat, never stay at this hotel ever again."
deceptive	i recently was in chicago on business and chose to stay at the swissotel, chicago. the hotel sells itself as being stylish, sophisticated and luxurious and says it is in the center of the city. i would have been better off anywhere else. i was not impressed with the interior, finding them bordering on clinical and too modern for my taste. i guess 'stylish' might be modern in some people's minds, but not mine. also, luxury to me means plush not hard and clinical. when i made my way to reception, i hardly encountered the friendly customer service boasted of on the website. i had organized an executive suite as i was planning to work some of the time from my hotel room, and thought the extra space would come in handy. when i proceeded to check in, the girl at the desk told me, while smacking gum, that i had no reservation. i handed over my booking confirmation and she told me that at first she had spelled my name wrong, even though i had spelled it out for her. she then proceeded to tell me that due to a conference, all of the executive suites had already been allocated, but that they would be happy to assign me to a lake view room. correct me if i am wrong, but this is a step down from the room i had asked for! surely if you give away my room, you should try to compensate me with something better! i said that no, i really needed more space as i would be using the room as an office, and finally she said that they did have a corner king room available, and that if i wanted to switch the following evening, i would be welcome to do that. the room was ok, although, again, i was disappointed by how cold and clinical it felt. i did attempt to make use of some of the hotel services, but found them sadly lacking. some comments on the services: the high speed wireless was not available in the room unless you were willing to pay a fee for a cable to connect, and also a per day fee which borders on extortion! there was free wifi in the lobby, but requires you to sit near the doors which open constantly letting in freezing blasts of air, plus deal with the noise and bustle of people constantly coming in and out. i did phone room service on my arrival to request an extra pillow and towels, but had to wait 2 hours before they arrived. the fitness center and pool which i was looking forward to using, were closed for cleaning when i went up. breakfast the next morning consisted of continental items, which is not what i would have expected for the money. all in all, i would say your money is better spent elsewhere.
deceptive	atrocious. here's our story: my wife and i are californians but met as students at the university of chicago. to celebrate our 10th anniversary, we decided to travel back to the windy city and revisit all of the places we frequented when we were first falling in love. when it came to lodging, we knew we wanted a suite but little else mattered. we wanted to revisit the city and didn't intend to spend very much time in our room. as a result, we didn't spend very much time researching hotels. big mistake. our stay at homewood suites could not have been worse. our room, which, i should mention, took a full two hours for them to prepare even though we had booked it months in advance, was filthy. (my wife found a dead cockroach in the bathroom.) the staff was rude and indifferent. the chocolates included in the romance package could not have cost the hotel more than a dollar. cleaning staff failed to show up. front desk offered apologies but little else. suffice it to say, we checked out early. never before have i seen such a poorly-managed hotel. truly shameful. stay away!
truthful	booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful nye, and was rather disappointed. bed was either the world's smallest queen, or was actually a double, not to mention it was uncomfortably springy. some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used (q-tips). lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly. when the tv was off, there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv. hot water was very inconsistent in the shower. it is in a great location, however, next time i will try one of the other hotels in the area like the intercontinental or marriott. this might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business, but i wouldn't recommend it for a romantic night or two.
truthful	all i can say is avoid this place at all costs. from the reservations assistant (who took 45 minutes to book a room) to check out (they billed my card for 750 dollars) and getting a refund (numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call). avoid avoid avoid a truely hideous experieince i will never stay at a starwood resort again, and given i stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement!
deceptive	great location in chicago downtown. the staff is professional and warm. the room is spacious and clean. nice complimentartry breakfast. i will definitely stay here again next time in chicago.
deceptive	"i was really excited to be visiting chicago for the first time, and the hotel that was recommended to me was the conrad chicago, located on rush street. i wanted a hotel that was conveniently located to all the downtown sites, and the conrad chicago does not disappoint in that respect. however, everything else about this hotel could be classified as sub-par, ranging from the rudeness of the check-in clerks to the roaches that were freely roaming in my room. this hotel does not deserve to be on anyone's recommended list. my first problem was a rude desk clerk who checked me in. after asking for three forms of identification (most places only ask for a driver's license) and asking me twenty questions about the reason for my trip to chicago, she reluctantly gave me a room key. i asked if there was a bell cap to help me with my bags and she said if i wanted to wait, one would be able to help in about 15 minutes. i didn't feel like waiting, so i dragged my bags to the room, only to find that the room key did not work! instead of dragging everything back down, i decided to use my cell phone to call the front desk, only there was no cell phone signal in the hall way. i couldn't believe i was in the middle of downtown chicago and the hotel did not have a signal! i finally flagged down someone from the housekeeping staff to let me into my room, but i immediately saw there were problems. two roaches scampered across the carpet and when i went into the bathroom, there were no towels or wash cloths. i went to turn on the tv and it didn't work. one of the lamps was missing a light bulb. i couldn't believe that this was happening to me. i was at the conrad chicago, not the motel six! i then sat down on the bed and the mattress was soft and lumpy. i was ready to cry. i was spending a lot of money on this hotel and it was a dump. i called down to the front desk and asked for another room, but they refused, saying i had gotten a special rate and it did not allow room changes. i insisted that they give me towels, fix the tv, put a light bulb in the lamp and have someone spray to get rid of the roaches. they agreed, but told me it would take ""awhile"" because several of their key personnel had called in sick. my stay at the conrad chicago was a nightmare from beginning to end. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone"
deceptive	i stayed in the homewood suites in downtown chicago last week, and i was extremely disappointed with my experience. the breakfast buffet was minimal and did not seem to be frequently restocked. i came downstairs about 30 minutes before the end of the breakfast period to find about half of the food options completely depleted. also, the milk provided for the coffee and cereals was warm, having been kept out on the counter. i would have been better off bringing my own food! also, the layout of the rooms is extremely awkward. i had to move the furniture around to be able to watch tv, and then move it back before i could make dinner or comfortably use the room in other ways. i could barely close the door to the bedroom past the corner of the bed. it just wasn't what i would expect from a hilton-brand hotel suite.
truthful	while this is a good location for shopping and sightseeing, i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. the rooms are small and bathrooms are tiny, all of which is to be expected in an old urban hotel, but apparently care has not been given to updating the hotel (ever!). the crown molding and base boards are cracked and it appears to only have been painted over and over again. the newer tub liner in the bathroom is merely floating above the old tub and when you stand in the shower it bubbles under your feet. the shower tiles are old and the grout is not clean. this hotel has not been restored the updating that has been done are merely band-aides. there is no fan exhaust in the bathroom and the carpet is ontop of a very hard surface, probaly concrete with no pad in between. the lobby is smokey because of the large open bar in the small space. we were in town on business and supposed to stay 4 nights, we left after 2 and went to another hotel.
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile the outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city. for the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night, you would think they would have a competent parking attendant. i was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room, and if that was not enough. to top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork. needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account. i would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations.
truthful	i stayed at the allegro for several days in august 2004 and i would defintely stay again. i had a very large room with a huge bathroom, although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout. the lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges, a nice place to enjoy the simple (2 choices, no munchies) but pleasant wine reception. at night, there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity, other than theater traffic, but it's a short cab ride to michigan avenue shopping and river north restaurants.
deceptive	i stayed at the affina chicago for my anniversary. the hotel is in a great location, but that doesn't make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff. it looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet. i spent more money than i would normally, hoping for a luxury experience, and left very unsatisfied.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the palmer house hilton in chicago for our anniversary. the hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a hilton brand hotel in a major city. the service was excellent with check-in and check-out going smoothly. the location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater, visit the lincoln park zoo and picnic by the lake. all of these were very close to our hotel. the price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations. we also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge. highly recommend.
deceptive	the hotel monaco chicago was a great hotel. the rooms were very nice, great customer service. every member of the staff was extremely nice. i liked that it was pet friendly, and you couldn't even tell they allowed pets. very clean. prompt service when requested, and the food was very tasty! an a+ in my book, the prices were very reasonable as well since it is a four star hotel. very immaculate. will definitely stay there again the next time i visit chicago.
truthful	the hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night. for three consecutive nights. there was simply inadequate soundproofing - even 14 floors above the street (ok - 13 floors as there is no 13th floor). i hesitate to write this review but i rely on trip advisor reviews when traveling, and had i been warned about the ambulance sirens, i would have chosen to stay elsewhere. if you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value. conveniently located. wonderful staff. but quiet is a key priority for me so i would not stay here again. :(
truthful	i only stayed out with my boyfriend for one night, however enjoyed my stay. the staff was friendly, the room was nice and clean, the hallways and ballrooms etc were elegant. room service was quick and had good options to choose from that actually tasted great. the staff was able to extend our check out time for an extra 1-2 hours without an extra charge to the room. great location too! walking distance from the art museum, millennium park, grant park (right across the street) and a quick cab ride to mccormick place. if i were in the city again i would love to stay there again.
truthful	we got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in chicago on 7/24/09. we went thru priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $69 (normal rate was around $200). the room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed. hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to michigan ave so the location is very convenient. parking is very expensive at $50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $30. we decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere. we ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict. they were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we didn't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast. glad we didn't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better. i highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your chicago visit.
truthful	we stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in august. we waited a while to check in even though there were quite a few desks open, this was a little annoying as the receptionists seemed to work in two's. our room had a great view of navy pier and was a good size. the bed was very comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. the location of the hotel is the best, we walked to navy pier and michigan ave. the breakfast buffet was great although a little pricey and the bar very relaxing for a nightcap or two. would certainly recommend this hotel and would stay here again.
truthful	i vacationed at the fairmont chicago for 3 nights in july 2009. the room, the bathroom, the view, and the staff were all wonderful. i just wish the hotel were a few blocks north (on mi ave). sometimes, when you're tired, that extra couple of blocks seem like miles!
truthful	my family and i stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in july, 08. we had (3) 1 bedroom suites. great location in downtown chicago. within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions. the service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly. the breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded. i recommend going early. the rooms were quiet and clean. i highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying >2-3 days. we would stay here again. parking is expensive, about $28/day. it is valet. the cheapest self parking i could find in the area was $24/days so we did valet parking. the valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly. this is my 3rd experience with homewood suites (3 different cities). i have had a great experience each time.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the james chicago hotel for our anniversary. this place is fantastic! we knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice! the rooms are beautiful and the staff very attentive and wonderful!! the area of the hotel is great, since i love to shop i couldn't ask for more!! we will definatly be back to chicago and we will for sure be back to the james chicago. betsy m, louisville, ky
truthful	"i want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time: the deal says ""free breakfast"" included in the price. however, what they don't tell you, is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit (or two)! moreover, you need to ask for these ""tickets"" at the lobby when you check in - they won't give them to you automatically! we stayed there over christmas '03, and we, and i noticed several guests who bought the same package, had a rather unpleasant experience! the hotel is nice though, if you don't consider their lousy service!"
deceptive	the location of this hotel was superb! our room was spacious and the view was spectacular. the staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect. one of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter. we will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same.
deceptive	amalfi hotel chicago is just minutes from navy pier, michigan avenue, the chicago opera theater, the house of blues, and the hottest night clubs. at $200.00 per night, you can expect the very best from your staff, and your accomodations. when i arrived for my weekend stay, i was greeted by a pleasant surprise of wall art, and eclectic style. after reaching my room, i was able to relax in peace on the numerous pillows. i didn't choose to use the spa this trip, but when i come back, it will be the first item on my list! the business office was great, because i had a last minute emergency with work- thank goodness for cocktail hour. breakfast was delicious. i have already told a friend from naperville that the next time i'm in town, she'll have to stay at amalfi with me, instead of commuting. she really missed out! -atlanta girl-
truthful	i was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the hotel allegro. however, our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. the room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another. the bathroom was small but well appointed. overall, it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. one other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and i can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe. the area is also very close to public transportation (we used the trains exclusively) and got around quite well without a car. we would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others.
deceptive	my stay at the homewood suites was absolutely one of my greatest stays away from home. the locations right in the heart of downtown chicago. within the river north shopping district.i love to shop so that was what i needed. magnificent 2 room layouts with kitchen. the room was fully equipted with anything i needed,nice flat screen along with a breakfast buffet and a fantastic complimentary dinner and wine. after dinner and wine i enjoyed the comfort of the heated indoor pool so relaxing. i would recommend these suites to everyone i know.
deceptive	we chose to stay at the hilton chicago because it was in such a centralized location- everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close! what i didn't expect was for the beds to be so comfortable. i can't remember when i got a better night's sleep. the staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept. we'll be returning to the hilton chicago the next time we're in town!
truthful	we love the location and proximity to everything. the staff was very friendly and courteous. they were so nice to our 2.5 year old boy. got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived. we got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program . can't beat that! the only minor issue is the elevator. we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room. it got a little annoying when we were going in and out often. otherwise, it was a great stay!
truthful	swissotel was the cleanest hotel i have ever stayed in! the room and bathroom were quite large for downtown chicago. the pool and hot tub were also very nice. i would definately recommend this hotel. we didn't hear any noise in our room from other guests or from the city. it is in a great location - walking distance to millenium park, the loop and michigan ave.
deceptive	the rates at the talbott hotel were cheaper than i had expected, and that was my reason for booking a room. i had been prepared for service and a room similar to what i had experienced in the past, and i was quite pleased when i did stay. the room was neat and clean, and the halls were quiet at night. the traffic noise was muffled to the point where it was no problem sleeping either. i did ask one question at the service desk and they answered it nicely, which is good because normally hotel workers can be a bit snippy, especially at night. overall i had no problems with the talbott hotel and i would stay at this here again if i were in the area a second time.
truthful	this is a great find for downtown chicago. the price is right and the staff are excellent. as noted, there is construction going on around the hotel, but i didn't notice any issues that disturbed sleeping. i asked for a quiet room on an upper floor, and was gladly given one. the lobby is small, the atmosphere is that of a small boutique hotel. the concierge, stephanie did a super job in finding us a restaurant and booking us reservations (along with a complimentary appetizer). we had a standard room, and it was spacious, tastefully decorated--everything we needed. the bathroom had a nice whirlpool tub for soaking--and the mp3 compatible radio was a nice perk. just can't say enough about how nice the staff are--every single person you meet. would definitely stay here again.
deceptive	"the hotel monaco is a hotel that some say has ""character"". i found the decor tacky and had a hard time relaxing in the room designed with clashing colors and ""contemporary furniture"". i found the fact that you have to be a member of the kimpton rewards club to get free wi-fi access to be annoying at the least. because of their pet-friendly policy, our room smelled like a wet dog, and a canine ""guest"" down the hall kept us up all night with his howling. perhaps the dog would have howled less if the 24-hour room service were faster. we waited an hour and a half for our order: meaning we did not get our dinner we wanted at 10:00 pm until midnight! all in all, we would not stay here again. the views and location are great, but for the money there are better places to stay in chicago."
deceptive	affinia chicago is one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed at. not in my life have i been treated so poorly as a guest. the front desk was very unaccommodating when i asked for a smoke free room when they had made an error in my reservation. there was no bellhop available for some strange reason so i had to move all my luggage to the elevator and down a long hallway to my room by myself. if it wasn't already a bad stay, i ordered room service and it took over an hour and a half to be delivered. if they didn't have air conditioning in the room, i would say just about everything about this stay was completely miserable. if you are traveling to chicago for any kind of business, i hope you decide not to choose this hotel. i was quite surprised, i like chicago as a city but this stay definitely made my trip quite a negative experience.
truthful	i arrived at the sofitel for a joint leisure and business. it is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable. the rooms are spacious, great beds, pillows and linen. the bathroom has a great shower and bath. wifi works really well and the desk is large. the staff are wonderful. the location is great for shopping, spa's, starbucks and hairdressers. i loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it.
deceptive	"the hilton chicago is one of the best hotels i have ever had the good fortune to lodge at in my entire life. it is an extremely luxirious hotel located on the ""cultural michigan avenue mile"", and it overlooks grant park, lake michigan, and museum campus. in addition to overlooking those wonderful sights, it's also located conveniently close to chicago's convention center, mccormick place convention center, as well as the business center, shopping and theatre. furthermore, there are a myriad of attractions close to the hotel, such as millenium park, buckingham park, and the sears tower. the amenities offered by the hilton chicago hotel include 100% wireless internet access in all guest rooms, 27"" inch flat screen televisions, a serenity bed, and two-line direct dial phones. and on top of all that, the hotel is pet friendly! i'll definitely be staying here again."
truthful	stayed at the chicago hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door i was very impressed. check-in was quick, easy and i was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check-in time. we were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant. it made getting ready to go out much quicker! the hotel location is great opposite the park, which is a must see. although located on south michigan ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of michigan ave. would also recommend the street one block back from michigan ave for good shopping. for breakfast i would recommend grabbing a muffin, croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant. for evening entertainment kitty o'sheas is a must. typical irish bar with good drinks and live music. finally the bed at hilton chicago is the most comfortable bed ever. i would have taken it home if i could! definately made for a good nights sleep.
truthful	"stayed with a group for a bachelorette party, and was disappointed. the hotel is beautiful, the staff was all rather friendly. the main problem was the room/sleeping situation. we had booked rooms with 2 queen beds several weeks before, but received an email a few days before our visit stating they were sold out (how that happens i don't know!!) so they ""upgraded"" us to two ""suites"" with a king and a pull out. first, this meant our party was split up and on different floors. second, that meant two of us were stuck on a pull out couch. :( i'm not a picky, unreasonable person, but that was the worst ""bed"" i've ever slept on! it was sunken in the middle so we literally rolled into each other unless we balanced ourselves on the very edge of the bed. then there were the springs poking into our backs all night! just awful! for the amount of money we spent i expected to be comfortable! i would not stay here again after this experience."
truthful	i had purchased this deal of off groupon. lets just say we found a bunch of hidden treasures. when we layed down to sleep in our bed. we lifted our blanket and found very distubing spotting on our bed (attached in photos), we immediatly called the front desk. the only thing they offered was a new set of sheets. when the room service men came to change the sheets he brought us another one with a big red stain on it and quickly/hid changed it before we seen it and he apologized and offered to bring us new ones once again. we denied since it was so late and just slept on the sheets the appeared to be clean. then next day i eagerly showed the fronk desk and manager the photos, and they offered me a ($68) refund. i was very dissapointed,and dirty sheets that made us very uncomfortable and sleepless and i broke out on my face with acne (i never had a acne or skin issues) im positive something in those dirtyy sheets. we drove 4.5 hours to enjoy chicago and we stayed @ the hard rock based on reputatuion, and unfortunitly we were very disspointed. it was disgusting! i then wrote a email to management and heard nothing back. not even a response or apology. i just really expected alot more.
deceptive	imagine flying to the windy city for business. after a long flight with many delays you get a cab to your hotel, the much-hyped conrad. you've been expecting to fall into a soft bed with a lovely view of the chicago skyline out your window. that's exactly how i imagined it after my delayed flight and terrible cab ride. that's the opposite of how it turned out. i got in to the lobby late and the person at the counter was busy talking on their cellphone. i approached and they didn't even hang up. they were going on about how they thought the whole charlie sheen thing was overblown. i don't care. it's late. i have meetings the next day. i try to check in and they say they can't find my reservation. this is despite the fact i have my receipt with me! finally, they check me in and don't even bother to have a bellhop help me with my bags. this isn't a cheap room. it's standard to treat your customers with some level of respect. i get to my room and i open the door and it's someone else's room! somehow they've given me the wrong room and activated my key for that person's room. worse yet, the occupant was passed out drunk on the bed with his clothes strewn all over the room. i have to carry my bags back downstairs and get checked into the right room. finally i get up there and my room is missing a pillow. seriously? how can the maid not notice. the bed was made. someone must've been in the room and seen that there was one too few pillows. this episode was exemplary of the rest of my stay. needless to say, neither i nor my business will be using the services of the conrad in chicago.
truthful	"this morning, i checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences i've ever had: hard rock hotel, chicago. i am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the ""preferred hotels"" group. upon checking in, i was ""greeted"" by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show. my room was poorly lit and dirty. the desk/desk chair was covered in sticky, dried soda pop (or something else?) which i had to clean myself so i could work. the ""sound system"" was put to shame by my 10-year-old daughter's boombox. no one, rock star or otherwise, wants to reach more than an arm's length for toilet paper. everything is possible. this includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the ""everything is possible"" line. great marketing fails with no follow through. the in-room mini-bar policy ranks in my personal top-five most ridiculous business practices of all time. do you charge steven tyler $7.81 for opening his in-room 'fridge? looking back, i would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty, drafty, overpriced bar (with a horrendous wine list) with the exception of the fact that i was leaving, check-out was no better than checking in. i wasn't even asked about my stay! the young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant. i, for one, will not bring my business back to that location. next time i'm in chicago, i'm staying at the hyatt. rock on, tripstarr"
truthful	excellent location, feels like a boutique hotel. right next to neiman marcus (v.expensive dept store) and 2 mins walk to john hancock tower. as most american ,medium to high end, hotels service was excellent from the bellhop to reception. upgrade to a suite if you are staying longer than a couple of days as walking around the windy city can be tiring and a suite feels like a small apartment. the pub in the basement is good for a sandwich and a beer. they will be refurbing so take adavantage of lower rates now as i feel they will be going for very high end clients after the remodelling
deceptive	my husband and i stayed in the hilton chicago and had a very nice stay! the rooms were large and comfortable. the view of lake michigan from our room was gorgeous. room service was really good and quick,eating in the room looking at that view, awesome! the pool was really nice but we didnt get a chance to use it. great location for all of the downtown chicago attractions such as theaters and museums. very friendly staff and knowledgable, you cant go wrong staying here.
truthful	"i had my wedding ceremony and reception at the sofitel. it seems as though i had the same experience as ""judy l."" i read her review and thought ""that's exactly what happened to me!"" here's what happened: the good news: the actual event was great. most notably, the food was absolutely incredible; i think almost every one of our guests has raved to us about the food. the same goes for the cake, which was made by take the cake. the service by the waiters and other staff was also very good. the bad news: michelle, the director of catering, honestly made my wedding planning process a nightmare. while we were negotiating the contract, she promptly responded to my emails and phone calls; after the contract was signed, it was a constant struggle to get in touch with her to get my questions answered, to schedule the tasting, etc. she frequently took over a week to respond to a simple email, and she occasionally never returned my email or phone call until i called her a second or third time. i assumed things would get better within the month--or even the week--prior to my wedding, but they actually got even worse. michelle just could not get it together, and if it weren't for my wedding coordinator's assistance in forcing her to finally get things right, i don't know what would have happened. thus, if it weren't for michelle's inability to do her job, i would have had a great experience. but, as it is, when i think back about my experience with the sofitel, i unfortunately have very negative thoughts. and that's incredibly disappointing, considering it was a major part of the best night of my life."
truthful	the reviews we read were a bit mixed, but i thought it was excellent. i've stayed in the splendido, villa d'este and others and it doesn't compare, but nor should it. it doesn't claim to be in that space. i expected it to be a notch off the four seasons and so it proved. a only a small notch too!. lovely clean and bright room. superb views, very quiet, comfy bed etc. excellent service all round and nice staff. for the money and quality it stacked up very well indeed. couldn't really fault it any way given it was half the cost of the four seasons but pretty close in terms of overall experience. we will go there again when in chicago. great location too.
deceptive	"i was in business in chicago, so i decided to choose what i thought would be a relaxing hotel to treat myself a bit. i should have known when the woman at the front desk rolled her eyes when i asked for some of the complimentary apple cider advertised. she told me, ""it's by the signs"" in a ""you-idiot"" kind of voice. too bad the signs were too far away from me to read without my glasses! i was ashamed and did not ask for anything from the front desk again. the room itself was horribly decorated and nothing special. the ""i'm too ugly to steal"" furniture patterns and colors did not say ""luxury"" to me! i went down to relax by the pool with my laptop, to get some work done. unfortunately, the pool was overrun with about five rowdy kids. no parents in sight. i would have reported them to the front desk, but was shamed by the aforementioned apple cider incident. thank god i left my laptop in its case, or it would have been ruined by all of the water that was splashed on me! the ""free breakfast"" tasted like cardboard; it was something akin to a free breakfast at a $60-a-night hotel. i only tried it once because it made me feel sick when i ate it. the only good thing about my experience was leaving this overpriced motel behind to go to work!"
deceptive	"we stayed at the millennium knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful. first off, the staff is excellent. all of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile. the hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that chicago has to offer. all of the shopping of michigan avenue was just steps from our room. we decided to go for the shedd aquarium package. we started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our ""all access pass"" to the aquarium (very cool!). after our long days of sightseeing (and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar), it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant, but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city. to top it all off, they have the most incredible shower that i've ever used (and, even better, it's all ""green""). what more can i say? the millennium knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable. i highly recommend it!"
deceptive	my wife and i stayed at the abassador east hotel in august to attend the air and water show in chicago. i called ahead to ensure a sw view that would allow us to watch the airshow from our room if the weather did not permit us to watch from one of the nearby beaches. upon arrival at the hotel, not only was our room on the west side of the hotel it wasn't even a single king as was requested. apparently the hotel had overbooked king rooms for the event weekend and we were downgraded to a queen room. the room itself was small and underwhelming. the was not dirty, but the linens and furnishings all had a very old and worn feel. the hotel was packed the weekend we visited. the staff was obviously not prepared to cater to such a large crowd. the concierge and reception desks were continuously busy. the hotel restaurant was very slow and had long waits. the main lobby and other common areas throughout the hotel were also undergoing renovations making getting around and fighting crowds of other people even more difficult! luckly the weather was nice and the airshow was enjoyable. we will not be staying at the abassador on future trips. hopefully, current renovations will provide a much needed lift to the hotels current worn down vibe...
deceptive	this was really an unexpected experience for me as far as hotel accommodations go. for this week's vacation in chicago, i heard several recommendations regarding lodging, but the james chicago was mentioned most emphatically. i expected an experience of comfort, luxury and customer satisfaction, but i was pleasantly surprised by the level of innovation and forward-thinking employed by every aspect of this hotel. the design is breathtaking -- modern, clean, stylish, sexy -- and its reflected everywhere from the lobby, shops and restaurants, to the stunning guest rooms themselves. my family and i felt energized by the smartly sleek environment we were in, and were impressed at every turn by the sophisticated take on hotel decor. far from a traditional hotel experience, this was like moving into chic, exclusive downtown apartment, and truly an upscale adventure in modern luxury living. impressive, too, was the hotel's overall approach to its guests and its use of the world's resources. from its offer of in-room recycling to the available bicycles for guest usage, the james offers a unique perspective on its place in the world, and gently helps its guests assist in maintaining that balance with ease and elegance. it's a respect that shows through, too, in other areas: support for artistic organizations, charities and other programs of merit, as well as chicago-centric packages compiled for guests so they can make the best of their stay, whether for a weekend, a week, or longer. the james chicago will definitely be our choice for accommodations whenever we revisit chicago. in fact, we may visit again solely to stay at the james!
deceptive	"the amalfi hotel advertises itself as a ""luxury boutique hotel"" and as such i expected my experience there to be somewhat better than average. unfortunately, this was not the case. the room i booked was not clean; in particular the bathroom looked as if someone had done a very minimal amount of cleaning after the last guest. there was hair in the corners of the room leading me to think the floor had not been swept or cleaned. in addition, although the room was supposed to be a non-smoking room, i could still detect the odor of cigarette smoke. i will say that the staff was courteous and the hotel is very well situated in terms of the many restaurants, sites and shops all within walking distance. however, given the cost of the room and my experience with the cleanliness of the room, i would not stay at the amalfi hotel again."
deceptive	first of all when you check in the check in process is smooth and takes no time at all, the front desk is very friendly and kind and make sure you know where your room is. then on the way to your room they have spots with chairs and a table to have a seat and visit with other guest if you prefer to be out of you room. the room it's self is very spacious and clean. the pool area is very clean and neat and you always have a towel, they never seemed to run out. the service is beyond exceptional. i would recommend staying at homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown to anyone.
truthful	my wife and i decided to spend three days in chicago last summer, and booked via expedia. when we first walked into the lobby we almost fell over at its' beauty. it's like something out of europe. we were able to get a free room upgrade, even though the rooms are still a bit small, but its' an old hotel in an old city. it's there for sleeping and showering. the restaurants, lounges, and shops were all wonderfull. the next time we travel to chicago, i'll be affraid to stay anywhere other than the palmer house hilton
deceptive	"my husband and i recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park. what i expected to be a very pleasant experience, turned out to be a stressful visit. we specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation. upon arrival, the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful. as we had no other options, we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds. i can live with the bed situation but i truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong! there wasn't an area in the room where i did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and i cannot help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out. to add insult to injury, the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something i think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation, partial refund or related ""perk"" to make up for our great inconvenience. two staff members actually acted as if i was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do! although we paid for the breakfast package, we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense. pardon the pun, but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel's lack of customer service! i am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but, thus far, we have received no satisfaction. needless to say, we will not be visiting this property again! in fact, we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels."
truthful	the conrad has all the right stuff - great bedding, fancy decorations, beautiful lobby, etc. however, they are seriously missing the boat when it comes to customer service and attention to detail. when i checked in, i went to get a glass of wine from the minibar, only to discover that everything in the fridge was warm. i called for help and was cheerfully told that they would send an engineer right away to fix it. in the meantime, i said, great, but what about a cold drink? they proceeded to send me 1 glass of wine via room service, without asking me if this would be okay. i paid $25 for 1 glass of wine. the minibar bottle would've given me 2 glasses for about $33. nothing was said to me about this obvious difference. when i called to complain, i was made to feel cheap. to me, it was not the money, it was the principle. the next morning, my bill showed that i had eaten something out of the minibar. i had not. i called, and they said that the automatic sensors in the minibar must have triggered something (duh - when the engineer came and took the entire fridge out of its compartment to fix it), and they took the charge off. they also took $10 off my room service bill, but i was still annoyed that nobody bothered to apologize or acknowledge the fact that i was overcharged. also, when they fixed the minibar fridge, they did not replace anything in it. the guy said, it'll take a while for things to cool down. oh, really? how about the warm beer, that was once cold, that will now taste disgusting? i guess they're saving that for the next person who checks into my room and has no idea. another annoyance was that the lighted mirror in our bathroom did not work. when i plugged it in, it made 2 other lights in the bathroom go off, and then it never would come on. it seems that the conrad thinks it can spend a lot of money to make itself look beautiful, without worrying about each customer's experience. i don't think they go into the rooms and check them out. and their sta
truthful	my boyfriend and i were amazed by the breathtaking view of lake michigan! we are from texas so the view of the city was very important to us. we had no problems at this hotel... rooms, service, location were top notch.
deceptive	my family and i vacation in chicago and stayed at the omni chicago hotel. upon our arrival we were greeted happily and the kids received free bagpacks for their stay which they loved. the staff was great and always greeted us as we walked in and out of the hotel. they even remembered our names! the location of the hotel was amazing, right on the magnificent mile. we really enjoyed our stay and the kids loved the indoor pool. i would definitely stay there again if i have the chance and would recommend it to anyone i know going to the chicago area.
truthful	i was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the hide a bed. i called the desk and asked for some and they said that i couldn't have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed. my husband was ill and i wanted the bed set up so i wouldn't disturb him. but they were un moved and wouldn't bring the sheets. i ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket. they could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket, i didn't pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress. seriously! lack of concern for the customer.
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers in december of last year and had one of my worst hotel experiences ever. first, when i went to check in, i was completely ignored by the staff, they were rude and seemed to have better things to do than help me check in. when i got to my room, all the way on the 23rd floor, the room was dirty and had not been cleaned. so back down to the lobby and they seemed to feel it was no big deal and gave me another room. i went back to check and the new room was dirty also. there were pubic hairs on the bed and in the bathroom. it appeared the maid only went into the room and picked up trash and made the bed but did not clean. all i can say is yuck! my next visit to the lobby the staff gave me an attitude about having to transfer me to another room again! extremely poor customer service and gross rooms. i felt like i was staying at a $30 a night roach motel, not the $250 a night sheraton. my advise is to stay away.
truthful	sometimes you just can't find fault with a hotel, even if you tried. such was the case with sofitel, where we'd never stayed before. it's a sleek, modern, sophisticated hotel with european touches. we spent three days there on a leisure weekend, we had a 29th floor king room looking directly at the hancock building, at a total cost including taxes and lugs of about $165 a night. the room was average sized, well-appointed, everything in it worked, and it had a fabulous view of the chicago high-rise jungle, including snippets of the lake. the public areas were wonderfully decorated. the restaurant served a good breakfast at, for chicago, reasonable prices. the staff was excellent. my wife broke her ankle several weeks before we visited and was on crutches. the staff loaned us a wheelchair and was very helpful in assisting her.
deceptive	"i was recently a guest at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers and was immensely dissatisfied. i arrived to find that they had ""lost"" my reservation. they told me they were booked solid even though i had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation. after nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in. he was almost helpful. he searched the database and found that there was a ""cancellation""; however, it was not for the type of room i had reserved. i had asked for a suite as i was going to be staying in the hotel for several days. i was given a box with a bed in it. they made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation. unfortunately, i was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked. i had no choice but to accept what they had offered. i begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here. do not stay in this hotel they will not help you with anything, even if it was their error."
deceptive	i really wish i could say that i liked this hotel, but the whole experience was just plain awful. my first warning sign should have been when i made my reservation. the person i spoke with when placing my reservation had absolutely no idea what he was doing. at first he tried to book me into the wrong hotel, and then when we finally got it sorted which hotel i was actually wanting, he booked me for the wrong dates. he read me the right dates, and it was only when i called back two days later to confirm that i found out he'd given me the wrong dates. hilton did get it fixed, but i already had a bad feeling about my stay. then came actually staying at the hotel. the people at the check-in desk were downright rude. then there was the room. i was supposed to be in a non-smoking room, but the room smelled strongly of cigarette smoke. the hotel staff refused to believe me, but did let me change rooms to one that didn't smell of cigarettes. however, i might as well have stayed in the first room. i was short towels, and it took four calls(over a period of 12 hours) to the front desk to get some. the sheets had not been changed, made obvious by the crumbs and fresh stains that littered them. yes, i was able to get fresh sheets, but like the towels, it took several hours for them to be delivered. since this is a pet friendly hotel, lucky me i got stuck in the room next to the room filled with yappy little dogs. the walls were so paper thin, all i could hear all night was barking. when i complained about it, the staff refused to believe me, and said that the walls of the room are so thick i shouldn't be able to hear anything from next door. yeah right. i was excited to use the pool, but just like my room, it hadn't been cleaned recently. then, i tried the fitness center. half the equipment was broken. i tried to cut my stay short, but of course this hotel wouldn't work with me at all. they even refused to comp my stay for all the grossness i had to deal with. i will never stay with hilton again, and i will be sure to let everyone know what a nightmare this stay was.
truthful	stayed at the fitzpatrick before, about 4 years ago, it was ok. the management was great, staff was so kind, and rooms were clean. ** but this time i promised my self never to go back!! the new staff was so rude!! i made a reservation for my anniversary on the internet, and the day of check in i was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation!** 1) i was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline. 2) staff was extremely rude! not arrogant, but rude! like they hated thier job. 3) they offered check in at 1pm but the room wasn't ready till 3pm! 4) there were stains everywhere! 5) because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site, they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff.
truthful	"my wife and i just spent a long weekend at the hardrock chicago hotel, and although i am not one to normally write long email, i felt it necessary to bring some of the disappointing experiences from our recent syat (2/14 to 2/17) to your attention.issues included: our friends ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered to our room upon arriving on 2/14 and we never got them. our friends later (on 2/16) asked us if we had received the strawberries, and we responded no. they then brought this to the attention of the hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to have received a complimentary bottle of champagne. we were then disappointed again, upon checking out, however, when we were accidentally billed for the ""complimentary"" champagne - which was later subtracted from our bill. the in-room dvd player didn't work. it was approximately 11 pm on 2/15 when we called the front desk for help with trouble-shooting the issue. the person responded friendly that ""al, the engineer, will be calling you back shortly"" to help. 10 minutes later there was a knock on the door, and it was al. a great and friendly guy, but we were waiting for a call back, not the arrival of a service tech - keep in mind it was late and we were already in bed. when al was not able to fix the dvd player, he graciously told us ""order a movie on us"" - thru the in-house movie selection. the problem: that didn't work either. again, al was awesome, and called the service provider, but they weren't able to fix it until after midnight. finally, after midnight al called us back, but by then the ""movie watching"" mood had sort of passed. i ended up watching the film ""hitman"" alone as my wife had already gone to sleep.the thermostat in our room didn't work, regardless of the temperature we set it to (set to 65 degrees - actual temperature = 76 degrees). we had so many other unresolved issues that we didn't feel it necessary to voice any more. ...read more"
deceptive	the hard rock hotel in chicago has it all: location, comfort, and rockability! we stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago recently and found it to be amazing! the location was perfect as it is walking distance to the magnificent mile, navy pier, and lake michigan. it was just a short ride by bus or cab to the sports stadiums, shedd aquarium or the museum of science and industry! the food, although it was pricey, was great! there is a spa on site if you need a little time to relax and recoup after all that rockin', and if you have pets, they get the royal treatment, complete with gifts! i would highly recommend the hard rock hotel of chicago!
truthful	even though the reviews of this hotel are very good, the only good thing about it is the location, which is excelent. aside from that, there are only 2 elevators, so there is always a wait to get in. they also seem to have insufficient staff so getting your luggage, room service, etc takes forever. even if you arrive in a cab, there is no space to load/unload so you have to block the street while you arrive/depart, the rooms seem a bit dated and in need of a refresh. all in all, there are much better options in chicago
truthful	i called the reservations line to book a room at the beginning of december 2012 for a rate with a local corporation. when i first made the reservation i did not get an e-mail confirmation. i had to call again to get the e-mail and then saw that i was booked in a handicapped accessible room which i did not need as there was me, my wife and three year old. i called the reservation line and asked for a regular room which they said was impossible at the rate i was at, however for ten dollars more i can upgrade to a regular room. i then asked what if a disabled person needs the room and he said he could not help me. i told them to cancel the room. based on the reservation experience, i did not want to run into anymore trouble at this hotel.
truthful	"my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel for the first 3 days of our honeymoon in mid-october. we decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of chicago in a week. i'll start out by saying that this was a great experience. at check-in, i indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite. the ambassador east is probably a 10 to 15 minute walk from the north end of the magnificent mile. it is also just a 2 or 3 minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on rush. our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed. our suite (on the 3rd floor) had two very large closets, a large ""living room"" and a large bedroom. the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough. if i would have payed full price for this suite, i probably would have given it a rating of 4, but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and i had such a great time here, i decided to give it a five. it is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful. my wife and i decided to eat at the pump room restaurant, but we were not very impressed. we found the food and service mediocre. the atmosphere was probably pretty neat when sinatra used to eat there back in the day, but not anymore. although we were unimpressed by the pump room, the staff were kind enough to seat us in the ""sinatra booth"" which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains. that neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here. the ambassador east is an older hotel, but it is in a charming older neighborhood. the staff's kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me. when we are in chicago again, we will definitely consider staying at the ambassador east again."
deceptive	the staff at the talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when i told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding, dong, ditch. the sheets smelled funny when i arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay. the room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap, but i did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room.
deceptive	i have to thank the ambassador east hotel for providing a really great experience for my family. we never leave our dog at home when we travel, and it's been a long time since we've been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets. the staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques. my husband liked the fitness room. it was nice and clean, with plenty of extra towels available. it was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water, but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves. we will definitely be staying here next time we visit chicago. we would make the trip just to stay here. that's how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel.
deceptive	my daughter's broken heart my daughter loves american girl and for her birthday wanted to go to american girl doll in chicago. for six months my eight year old counted day the day until we left for chicago when she could have the experience of a lifetime. we arrived at the talbot hotel where we had reserved the american doll girl package only to find out that they had given our room away and that they were going to move us across town. if that wasn't bad enough we had to spend an hour to find out if the american girl carriage ride had been canceled or if we should book another one. my daughter sulked for most of the trip as we spent more time going from thing to thing instead of being able to walk. my daughter cried herself to sleep the first night and i could tell that her heart was broken.
truthful	ok, i just feel if you're paying well over $200 for a room you should get something to show for it. the location was on michigan ave but if i pay just a little more i could have had way better (peninsula, park hyatt, shoot the omni was 10x better). we ordered a deluxe executive suite, and it was so below sub par. the room was very small (so small the ice bucket was in the closet), the bathroom was just as small, just well lit (a plus). wallpaper was peeling, outlets barely covered, no view. the only thing appealing was the bed, and that may have been because i was so tired. and we were really excited because this is the palmer house. the palmer house does have nice restaurants: the lockwood (quiet, distinguished) and the potter's lounge (grown/sexy)
truthful	we experienced bed bugs in our room while staying at the omni chicago hotel on the magnificent mile. we never received a return call from general manager sanjay mahajan after several voicemails. we will never return to the hotel and will work to spread the word. we also heard from several employees from the cleaning staff that this is common in the hotel.
truthful	the hotel is almost always very helpful. this stay caused me to re-think if i like the palmer house. i had dirty covers for the bed. it was also the smallest room in the hotel i am sure. my husband and i usually come 8 times each year. he is there doing business and cta work. we are not pleased with the size of the room at all now. rooms have always had two chairs, desk, and usually 22 by 25 feet. not this room on the 11th floor. it was only 15 x 17 approx. the service men at the doors have always said a welcome but not this time. in the past we had a bell man steal a $300. pair of sun glasses and the hotel did nothing about our loss financially.
truthful	simply a nice place to stay... i had a great deal for the room, and was impressed with the quality. hotel staff was very helpful; they were able to let me check out and helped me print boarding passes. negative: it is frustrating that nowadays you do not have free internet in most hotels and it's the same here; you have to pay for the internet. negative: loud on the phone you may hear your neighbors on the phone, or them shower.
deceptive	the hotel is located in an hard to fins location in chicago, the dining room for dinner is uncomfortably crowded, the room service is hard to reach, overall it was not a pleasant hotel stay.
truthful	this is an older hotel, and the age shows. rooms are small, and a bit drab. bathroom in my room was in urgent need of upgrade. bed was comfortable, though, and the room was quiet, hotel staff was polite, but not really interested in the guest. even the concierge was disinterested. check-in was irritatingly slow for the few number of people in line. really, a hotel tjhat promises so much in its promotional material should deliver better. the hotel really didnt seem to be trying.
deceptive	my wife and i stayed at the affinia chicago last week (in a studio suite, which was not worth the extra payment). it was an absolute nightmare! to begin with, the room is listed as 'oversized', when it's nothing of the sort. we've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller. i believe the only extra space was in the closet, which isn't very useful unless you plan on living there! we had our two sons with us, so we had to make extra sleeping space. our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time, complaining of bugs moving around. he must have been umcomfortable also, as i sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock. the room service is horrible, they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm, and she had to wait up for that. my family would never go back to this hotel, and i highly recommend you also stay well away.
truthful	"we went to chicago for my 2nd wedding anniversary and stayed at homewood. my first impression was great, very helpful valet employees and very nice. that is one perk of my stay here. otherwise, we had no problems checking in other than the hotel has 19 floors and when we booked the room we asked that we have the highest room avalible due to the fact that it was my husband first time there and the higher up, the more beautiful the view is. so we got the 9th floor. not what i call ""high up"" when the rooms started on floor 6. then the following morning, we went to breakfast of which was ok, nothing great. my husband and i went down in jeans and a sweatshirt but had not really thought about shoes as we thought it would just be a few bagles, some fruit, and that was it. so, we got our food and sat down. after getting stared at for the first 15-20 minutes, an employee came and told us that we wernt allowed to eat breakfast without our shoes on. remind you, it was about 15-20 minutes after we had even entered the room. so she asked that we go get shoes while sitting down and eating our breakfast. pretty pointless after we already had gotten our food. i am sure it is because very few employees could speak understandable english that it took so long. last but not least, dont come with a clean car. i had washed my car one day prior to arriving there and when it was returned, it was filthy dirty."
deceptive	the hotel allegro located in the chicago loop, provided my wife and i with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. we ordered the weekend liquid therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website, but to our surprise when we arrived, our names were nowhere to be found in their system! no room, no accommodations at the restaurant, nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. a weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than i originally booked, and never did they offer us a replacement dining option! i have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time. we will never be staying here again.
truthful	spent a wonderful night at the amalfi with friends. the evening reception was very nice and the staff was very attentive. breakfast was a plus, rooms were cozy and very clean. would not hesitate to go back again.
truthful	i'm a frequent business traveler and often in chicago on trips. at times, it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown chicago, and this was one of those times. i recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the allegro. it was absolutely not worth it. the hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers, so check-in and check-out were very slow. there were very few elevators, which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. the morning i checked out, our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby, but the elevator was almost completely full when i got on at the 18th floor, so i can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. the room was extremely small and cramped, even though it had obviously been renovated recently. the tv, bed, and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. still, the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. the best thing about the allegro was the room service, which was prompt. the food was good, and the prices were very reasonable for room service. from now on, if my regular hotels are booked, i'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it.
deceptive	the hyatt regency in chicago was a wonderful experience for my husband and i as we traveled through the area on vacation. after checking in we simply relaxed in the beautiful atrium for a while before going to our room. to our delight the room was very clean, ultra-modern and furnished with sleek and comfortable furniture. what really impressed us about the room was how spacious it was and the stunning river front views. we were pressed for time to make dinner so decided the bistro sounded like the best option and it turned out to be a great choice! the food was simply fabulous. after dinner we were able to try out the fitness center, which ended up making our gym at home seem inadequate. this was just what we needed as a restful base for our chicago vacation and we will definitely stay here again.
truthful	"i made reservations with the chicago fitzpatrick using their 800 number for two nights in june. i received no written confirmation with cancelation policy, etc. however, when i attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night's reservation, i was told that they would charge me for one nights stay. they have a ""3pm the day before your first nights stay"" policy. even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy. this is not a common policy on michigan ave. i'd advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy. it was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel!"
truthful	very centrally located in the loop directly south of the 7th day adventist church (my room looked down upon wacker drive, the aforementioned church and the chicago river. small room, virtually no storage space. attended a conference with the monaco as venue. they provided adequate service, with no problems. this was the first time i spent with a kimpton hotel and i registered for their frequent stay program. i never felt comfortable in this hotel. i'm 60 yrs old and it appears the clientele they target is half my age. rude front deskperson of unidentifiable gender. the young people can have at it. i'll stay at the marriott michigan ave next time.
truthful	"staying here currently. had aspired to sleep. the paper thin walls allow even the slightest peep from your neighbor to feel like you're right in bed with them. couldn't sleep anyway because of the cheap, giant fluffy pillows. called housekeeping, asked for any help...was simply and accomodatingly told, after my plea for help, could they, would they have any ability to supply me with a reasonable pillow? complete answer before hanging up: ""we do not."" hyatt, may your well executed service lead to your demise. happy"
deceptive	we booked this trip several months in advance and were greatly looking forward to our stay at the hotel monaco in chicago. however, our experience was significantly different from what we expected, for the following reasons. first of all, there was only one person at the front desk when we arrived. that person was preoccupied with something on their computer so our presence was not acknowledged for several minutes. then when we got to our room, there were beautiful drapes in the window and across one entire wall but i found them to be incredibly dusty. just bumping into them slightly caused a cloud of dust to emerge which i found distasteful. overall it was a good stay but those two inconveniences made us question the amount of money we paid for it.
truthful	we stayed at the fairmont two nights for the sofa art fair at the navy pier. i was impressed that the bellman called us by name when he met the taxi and pronounced it correctly, which is quite unusual. everyone smiled and welcomed us. the lobby looks clean and friendly, not ultramodern, but not at all tired or worn. our room, also clean and comfortably furnished, was larger than we expected, with a clean, modern bath and a lovely view of the navy pier and the lake. we did not eat at the restaurant, but it looked attractive. our only problem was that we had asked for non-feather pillows, upon reserving the room, upon checking in, and calling housekeeping. after waiting an hour, we went to bed. the next day the check-in desk person was extremely apologetic and by the time we returned, all the feathers were replaced with foam and non-allergenic materials. the hotel is convenient to millenium park and michigan ave. we would stay there again, assuming we could get good rates.
truthful	i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone wanting accommodation in chicago. ideal position, lovely quiet rooms, good facilities, complimentary breakfast well received and the manager's evening drinks reception excellent; we always tipped the staff who were serving our drinks. the in-house amalfitini cocktail was very good. the staff were very friendly and helpful. if i ever return to chicago i would certainly stay there again. theres nothing bad i can say about this hotel.
truthful	"hi ho hi ho, off to chicago we go. here's the skinny, if you're hoping to run into a washed up rock star (cece deville for us, and no the teenagers had no idea who he was) you may want to spend your hard earned money here. i took my younger sister and a couple of her friends (teenagers) for an overnighter in chicago on our way to wisconsin. i chose the hard rock for the ambiance. i mean come on it is supposed to be ""cool"". well it wasn't. the positives: *it is in the carbon & carbide building, which is beautiful. *the location: it sits in the middle of everything *the lobby has two computers for guest use. *the fitness center is very nice. cardio machines have individual tv's and there are head phones in case you forgot yours. they have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack. *check-in and out was quick and valet was very courteous. the negatives: *the rooms were small and ours wasn't clean (pistachio shells on the floor). the rooms were painted purplish gray (we were on the prince floor) with a picture of bob marley hanging on one of the walls. the girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows. *bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub. *the cable reception was poor; i kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture. *it isn't anywhere near the hard rock cafe. *there was very little memorabilia. *there is no pool, and yes i knew this when i made the reservation. to wrap it up, i won't be staying here again. if i am going to drop almost 4 benjamins on a hotel room, i will stay at the palmer house hilton. but that is a whole different review."
deceptive	the amalfi hotel chicago is perfect for a romantic get-away. my husband and i spent a weekend away from the kids there and i must say, we were impressed by the staff and the accomodations. we especially enjoyed the in-room spa service. i recommend the amalfi to anyone wanting a nice hotel in the downtown chicago area (you are within walking distance of shopping) with great customer service and luxury accomodations!
truthful	very very noisy - constant water running through pipes. it was terrible!! there are much better hotels to stay at in chicago. thier parking rate is obnoxious ($42.00 a night) and way too far out to walk to much. if you must stay here, try to park for free on dead end street (feed meter on weekdays) and take the stairs down to the next street level and you will find a jewel grocery store for sodas/snacks. (a can of soda at the hotel was $4.50 plus 18% restocking fee!!)
truthful	first, several day s prior to my stay, i called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service saturday and sunday. saturday they didn't bring breakfast - and when i called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge. when they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on sunday. i was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service saturday night. the food was limp and uninspired. further, i ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon. when i called in-room dining to request a spoon, i was told one would be forthcoming. 15 minutes later, a waiter arrived with a menu. when i explained i already had food and i didn't need a menu - i needed a spoon, he had the audacity to argue with me. i respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so. another 15 minutes (and one bowl of cold soup) later i decided to call in-room dining back to request (again) they send someone with a spoon. they too argued with me and expressed that they'd already sent someone with a spoon. i explained that they had not - that i had received a menu i didn't request, but that no spoon was forthcoming. another 15 minutes later, a spoon finally arrived. thanks - for charging me $100+ so that i could argue over cold, flavorless food. in addition to the gross customer service, surly attitude, and sorry food, i found the room woefully lacking. it reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on saturday night i woke up from the smell. further, i had specifically requested when i booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators... i was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went.
deceptive	my husband and i satayed for two nights at the hilton chicago,and enjoyed every minute of it! the bedrooms are immaculate,and the linnens are very soft. we also appreciated the free wifi,as we could stay in touch with friends while staying in chicago. the bathroom was quite spacious,and i loved the smell of the shampoo they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. their service was amazing,and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool. i would recommend staying here to anyone.
truthful	i have stayed at the amalfi hotel before and it has always been excellent. this time was no different. usually i book direct with the hotel, however, i found a slightly better deal booking through expedia, which saved about $100. the staff were great. i arrived early and they had a room waiting. i was placed on the 6th (top) floor and it was quiet and comfortable. overall, it was as good as it gets! i will definitely continue to stay here when i'm in chicago. remember, the hotel is close to everything - downtown, the magnificent mile, lots of restaurants, etc. everything is within walking distance!
truthful	i was very disappointed with the hotel this time. they seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit. the clientele also seem to be of a lower quality. the lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice. the house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee; she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room. i think i will have to stay with the intercontinental next time.
truthful	i stayed at the hilton chicago last week and was very disappointed. the highlight of the stay was waiting 20 minutes for a bellman to come and get our luggage. finally, my 72 year old mother, 8 year old son, and myself gave up and dragged it all down to valet parking ourselves - no easy task. the security guard was kind enough to hold the door for me. the valet parking attendants looked over and then ignored us. as far as i could tell, he was just standing there doing nothing. i couldn't let go of the bags without everything falling so i gave my son the parking receipt. the attendant pointed to where our car was parked - no short distance away. my 8 year old had to tell him to pull it up. they should have been ashamed. less significant, but irritating issues. the pool is part of the hilton athletic club. two lanes are reserved for adults wanting to lap swim. basically, two adults can take up 2/3rds of the pool while everyone else is consigned to the leftover 1/3rd. this is ridiculous and very family unfriendly. in addition, the pool closes at 9 p.m. what pool closes at 9? we stayed for 3 nights. not one single additional bar of soap, bottle of shampoo, or coffee stirrers.
deceptive	thanks sheraton towers for the invite to enjoy your indoor pool while a guest at your hotel recently. i did not know that the skyline of chicago could be so beautiful or an afternoon at the pool so enjoyable. i'll be back soon and look forward to a seeing chicago again.
truthful	"ok, we are back from the knickerbocker and i would give it the best rating. i can't believe the bad reviews. i got a priceline deal, and i still got a fine room, clean, up-to-date furnishings (ok a little traditional for my taste) and smoke free. someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews. i think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth. here it is from my point of view. both rooms on 10th floor. regarding the size of the rooms. we had two rooms. one was a 2 double bed room. it was about 20' x 15'. each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies. the furniture, bathroom tile, shower (no tub), wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years. a chinese inspired cabinet held tv, coffeemaker, ice bucket, and mini-bar. three separate levels (tv, ice/coffee, and minibar) the other room was called ""queen executive"". this one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence, sofabed, two tvs and terry bathrobes. also about the same size but different configerations. one tv faced the bed, other in the three level cabinet, the sofabed. smoke in the lobby. there is a bar to the right of the entrance. it is an open arrangement so that i am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door. no smoke smell in no-smoking rooms. cost of rooms $75 on priceline plus taxes. very good value one block from n. michigan ave. only complaint. concierge said that the free trolley didn't go down michigan ave to field museum/museum complex when in fact it does. was this ignorance? or trying to throw more business to taxi? either case, not good. he said at this time of year free trolley only goes to navy pier during winter....which is clearly incorrect."
truthful	our room was on the third floor so there was some street noise - but it certainly didn't spoil our 4 nights in this lovely hotel. wine tasting evening went down extremely well after a day seeing the sights of the city!! our goldish was called oliver - nobody could believe we had our very own goldfish in our room!! all the staff were really helpful and welcoming, making our stay here very relaxing and comfortable. would certainly recommend this hotel.
deceptive	eww! what a sickening affair; the hotel monaco chicago is a stuffy masterpiece of a hotel done wrong. i stayed there recently and the rooms reek of the pretended elite classes whom fill its rooms. i seriously was afraid to even lie between the sheets for fear of being charged a hefty linens fee... i stayed in chicago for a week; i stayed at the hotel monaco for one night!
truthful	"this is one of my favorite sheratons/starwood properties. i have stayed at a lot of hotels (mostly starwood) in chi but all around, this is my favorite based on cost, amenities and downtown location. i really like it beginning with unloading the taxi because i am greeted by nick who has been there for years. he gives the best greeting from la to ny and is always happy! he obviously loves his job. people at the front desk are always nice and efficient. if you like to workout, roberta runs their fitness center. another one who loves their job and serves guests well. great lake / river view while working out. on this particular trip i was caught in a pinch; however, christy the former mgr was able to take care of a frequent guest. i considered it a ""minor miracle"" based on hotel availability. the maids on 29th floor were very friendly and efficient. another great experience."
deceptive	affinia hotel in chicago was one of the most interesting hotels i have ever stayed in. everything looks very nice and fancy, though the people that work there must be from the projects of chicago. the customer service was the worst i have ever experienced in my life! when we went to check in, first we had to wait about 15 minutes for the 3 workers that were at the desk to stop their personal conversation and check us in. when the women at the counter finally acknowledged us, she was smacking her gum, and was upset and treating us like we were inconveniencing her! the room service brought us cold eggs for breakfast, and the attitude of the staff overall was extremely rude. i would never go back, and i hope this place gets a staff makeover if they want to stay in business.
deceptive	overpriced is the best word to describe the conrad chicago hotel. while it may be in downtown chicago, the room had no view. although i asked for non-smoking, the room reeked of smoke. the elevators were very slow, and one was not working during my stay. there was a stain on the pillow, and the leg of one of the chairs in the room was broken. there was a dead bug in the bath tub. i was only given 2 towels for my 4 night stay. my credit card was billed twice, and it took 2 weeks to reverse to extra charge. i do not recommend this hotel at all!
truthful	i was completely blown away by this hotel. it was magnificent. i got a great deal and i am so happy that i stayed here. before arriving i was nervous as i had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay, for example very noisy. however, whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant, it made no difference to me. my room was huge, bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure, bed was perfect and the view was amazing. hotel is so close to the great shops of magnificent mile, plus a comfortable walking distance to hancock tower and millennium park.
truthful	"i travel a lot for business and quite frankly, my expectations were starting to reach new lows. i usually always choose w hotels just for the consistency (of average hotels). the affinia in chicago has raised my expectations and w hotels are going to suffer in comparison. this hotel is one of the cleanest i have stayed at in some time. service was impeccable. friendly front-desk staff and the extra towels i ordered arrived literally within minutes. the gym has new equipment with plenty of space. and such a fun vibe - without dark hallways and loud music. i have to thank the other reviewers - their reviews led me to the affinia and i was so pleased. my new ""chicago hotel"". it will even lead me to try the manhattan hotels."
truthful	our non-smoking room smelled very badly of stale cigarette smoke. we were not allowed to change rooms. also, the concierge staff was unprofessional, telling long winded personal stories to uninterested guests while long lines formed. the location was great. hotel is dated, but would still be a nice place to stay if it weren't for customer service issues.
truthful	we loved the hotel. when i see other posts about it being shabby i can't for the life of me figure out what they are talking about. rooms were large with two bathrooms, lobby was fabulous, pool was large with two hot tubs and huge gym, staff was courteous. for us, the location was great--across the street from grant park with a great view of buckingham fountain and close to all the museums and theatres. i'm sure others would rather be north of the river closer to the magnificent mile but we enjoyed the quieter and more scenic location. got it for $105 on hotwire. what a bargain for such a nice hotel.
deceptive	homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown is a wonderful hotel. the hotel is very elegant, classy and only offers the best. the hotel offers complimentary breakfast, along with delicious meals and wines in the afternoons. the suites are very real designed and has a very upscale look. this wonderfully cozy yet graceful hotel leaves you with an experience of a lifeltime. i would recommend this awesome hotel to anyone that was looking for beautiful, yet comfortable hotel experience.
deceptive	i stayed at the the conrad chicago hotel last winter with my family and i couldn't be happier with are choice. the staff was very polite and helpfull and the rooms were very comfortable and felt like home. i loved the area of chicago the hotel was in there wasnt alot of crim around and i felt safe being in a new city.
truthful	the hotel is well located, but the service is poor. they seem to cater to large conventioneers, with service more like a moderate chain hotel - not your typical fairmont. there are too many specifics to outline here, let's just say that from the front desk, to the spa, room service which only got my order correct one-day, to housekeeping which didn't even clean my room one day (although they sent a manager to inspect the room because the housekeeper said she did clean the room. yep, that's just what you want to come home to after 10 hrs of meetings! they did offer me a complimentary breakfast for my inconvenience! the hotel is large and many times between 5-7 pm there would literally be a long line of guests waiting for an elevator. i've stayed at this fairmont twice. the 1st time i attended a conference nearby and the last time l chose it for the price. but it's not worth enduring such poor service. that was the last time for me.
deceptive	"problems started when i booked the intercontinental chicago online at the hotel's site, and got a server error. somehow i managed to get my reservation, and wish i had looked elsewhere on this great chicago street, filled with plenty of other options. the server errors continued at check in and didn't let up. i was on a holiday weekend, but far too many others must have been pushy conventioneers, and i had trouble getting served. the hotel is enormous and doesn't give a sense of comfort. the health facilities are also just too big, so noisy and crowded. and internet access was $18 a day, kind of surprising when i can go around the corner to a starbucks! next time, i'll pick a more intimate place nearby--without so many ""server errors""."
truthful	i had a large, roomy, clean 2 bed room with a large bathroom, big minibar snack assortment and was tucked away nicely in the corner so that there was no hall noise. customer service here was absolutely incredible, from the doorman to the front desk, to the gentleman who delivered my toothpaste to my room when i requested it. sure, you get a little outside noise, but it is a big city, that is not unusual! i really enjoyed my stay here and strongly recommend it.
truthful	the hotel lost our reservations and then couldin't accommodate what we needed. they gave us a room much smaller than we needed and when we requested something diffrerent they were unable to fulfill our request. we opted to leave the hotel and after there mistake of losing our reservations, they still charged us an early check out fee. if it wasn't for the great location of the hotel, there would be nothing positive to say/
truthful	i arrived here at about 8pm after a flight from california. i didn't know about the renovation when i made the reservations, but that didn't bother me very much. i was helped by a man at the front desk named ben, who was friendly enough, but literally just handed me my room key and told me to have a nice stay. he gave me no information about anything. i had no idea where breakfast was served, or even if there was breakfast. there was also an extremely unpleasant woman working behind the desk(she wasn't wearing a name tag but was african american, slim with short hair) who seemed to be actually radiating hostility. it made me very uncomfortable and needless to say, made me feel unwelcome. i actually felt like i was putting her out by staying in the hotel. i encountered her again the next morning when i had to go downstairs to ask a question and again tried to smile at her a bit, and again was met with utter disdain and rudeness. i also watched her interact with another guest and saw her act with the same rudeness and bad manners. no matter what may be going on in one's life, when you work in customer service you need to leave whatever is happening at the door and put on a smile. i was appalled by her demeanor. my room was alright, there was no clock which i found very odd. since i came from a different time zone my computer and phone had 2 different times and i was constantly confused as to which one was correct, especially upon waking up in the morning. it would have been nice to have a clock. there was also no literature on local sites, maps, restaurant menus, or even anything with the hotel's name and address in the room. also, the mattress was the absolute worst mattress i've ever slept on in my life. i woke up every morning with a sore back and neck. i've had better sleep on a hard, lumpy futon. it was absurd. like another person posted, my tub did not drain either, and i was also shocked that there were no soda machines or ice machines to be found. maybe they were around somewhere, but i wasn't made aware of it at check-in, and i didn't want to go downstairs and ask for fear of being treated like i was a burden to the employees. the hotel is in a good location and the rooms look nice upon first glance, but i absolutely would not stay here again. i've had more pleasant stays at a cheap chain hotel, which was a bummer because it was my first visit to chicago and i had pretty high expectations.
truthful	my 3 nieces and i stayed here for a long weekend, we had a wonderful time. we arrived early around 8:30am and they let us into our room. this was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later room was very clean as was the bathroom. with 4 women we needed extra towels, they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered. room was also quiet, construction going on behind us and we never heard anything. beds comfy and so were the quilts... good location for michigan ave. all in all a wonderful stay. would return.
truthful	my husband & i stayed at the fitzpatrick in early june 2004 for my birthday-great hotel! location provides easy walking to navy pier, marshall field, michigan avenue & john hancock. room seemed spacious even though its only about 300 sq ft. lots of room in bathroom; comfortable bed; very quiet, upscale hotel. we would definitely stay here again!
truthful	we stayed in a king suite at the hotel allegro over memorial day weekend. we paid $130/night, and it was definitely a bargain. the suite was huge - living room with a couch, two chairs, desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. the room had recently been renovated, and was very clean. comfortable bed, friendly staff, great location (near the train and bus), evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. while the allegro isn't a five-star hotel, it is a great place for the money. (note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room, and reported that it was very small. upgrade if possible).
deceptive	"this might be a classy looking hotel in downtown chicago, and while the location is not bad, the rooms are definitely hit or miss. they range from the super basic ""affordable"" room to the presidential and huge suites that only presidents could probably even afford. with so many different room options, it's no wonder they have difficulty honoring your exact reservation if you check-in past 4:00 pm. the hotel has a decent pool, but the health club is extra per day, as are many other services at the hotel. you'd imagine that for the price of a stay here ($160 up to multiple hundreds) that more things would be included! additionally, the check-in staff was a bit snobby and unhelpful. i really would expect great service for the high price of a stay here. if i were to return to chicago again, i'd definitely try out staying somewhere else."
truthful	i stayed at the fairmont chicago for one night - i'm a frequent business traveler and am very familiar with travel rituals. i checked in late (almost 10pm) due to flight cancellations from my home airport -- atlanta. i took the shuttle to the airport (best option in lieu of the over priced taxis), and it was my first time staying at the hotel. upon arrival, i immediately noticed the entrance, which appeared very welcoming and warm to me. i checked in with no problems -- and the desk person even asked if i'd prefer a king or double (reconfirming my reservation preference). i always take the king when i can, and the bed was fantastic! it was suited with great linen and these incredible down & feather pillows named encompass made by the pillow factory -- i checked the tags, since i plan to buy some! i ate dinner at the hotel restaurant - aria, which they mention they like to be considered separate from the hotel -- and yes, it does stand out all on it's own. the food is asian fusion, and truly wonderful -- as a gourmand and life-long foodie, i appreciate great food when i taste it! the hotel service was good as well. only drawback was the breakfast buffet at the restaurant -- seems they need to stick with their dinner theme solely. they missed the mark on relatively simply things like scrambled eggs on the buffet, which tasted a bit 'metallic'. but they made up for it by getting a special order made immediately after i passed on the buffet. i would highly recommend this hotel -- it has atmosphere and a great view (if you can get a room with one), fabulous dinner -- just pass on the breakfast buffet.
truthful	i travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list. the room had such a strong odor of smoke, it gave me a headache (and i used to be a smoker)! the room service was mediocre and extremely expensive. the hotel is disturbingly huge. very difficult to navigate your way around it. i waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located. she curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up. uhhhhh, how do i know which direction to go in??? stains on the carpet in the room. a big gauge in the wall, where maybe a thermostat once was??? the shower is decent. all in all, for the price they charge, no thanks!!! i'm just glad my company is footing the bill.
deceptive	i stayed at swissotel chicago when i was on business and it was very nice. the staff was very helpful and room was very clean. i would stay again in a heart beat!
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel is amazing little get away right on the magnificent mile in chicago. this hotel is warm and homey as well as modern and filled with amenities! the beds are very comfortable and there are flat screen televisions in the rooms (at least both times i have stayed). the windy city spa provides a relaxing getaway as well.the indoor pool provides something fun for all ages and the customer service was excellent. the garage was very secure and has unlimited in/out priviledges which made it nice to be able to access the car as much as you wanted without any penalty. all in all, well worth it and will plan to stay again!
deceptive	i must say, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. my wife and i were blown away by the penthouse fitness center and pool all the way up on the 42nd floor. very well designed rooms with great linens and pillows. the bathrooms were a nice change of pace from the boring hotel bathrooms we usually see. overall an excellent experience here, great views and close to everything you could want to do in chicago.
deceptive	i had such a horrible experience when i stayed at omni chicago hotel last saturday night. first of all, the plasma tv in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available, and they weren't particularly apologetic about it, either. secondly, it was supposedly a non-smoking hotel, but as an ex-smoker, i can tell that people had smoked in the room recently. additionally, the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels, which was really disappointing, because i was looking forward to using the pool. finally, check-out was supposed to be at noon. at 11:15 am, the maid was knocking at the door. she asked if i would be out soon, and i thought was very quite intrusive. i will never, ever stay at that place again.
truthful	if you asked me two years ago, i would have recommended the talbott hotel without hesitation to anyone who asked. now, i have definitely changed my mind. while this hotel is located in a nice area of chicago, surrounded by great restaurants, shops and affluent people, it has really begun to slowly downgrade. as noted by my reviews, i am incredibly serious about customer service. if you're in the hospitality industry, there is really no excuse for falling short in this category--- but alas, the talbott really has. the door staff don't say a word, the desk people acknowledge you only when they are not doing a million other things (which they always are) and the staff have an air of snobbishness. inexcusable since we, the customers, are paying to stay at their over-priced hotel. perhaps the most annoying aspect of my latest stay was that i had to walk down 11 flights of stairs to get to the lobby of the hotel because i waited a solid 15 minutes for the elevator, which, when it arrived, was packed to the brim. i get that it's an old hotel, but it is incredibly annoying that they only have two elevators for the entire place and when one is down for construction, the other one overflows with people and i am forced to walk eleven flights to simply get to my dinner reservation on time (which i didn't.) i will not continue giving this hotel my business and have other better recommendations to give to friends who plan on visiting.
deceptive	upon arrival at the ambassador east hotel in chicago, i was immediately impressed with the courtesy and attentiveness of the staff. from the moment we checked-in until we left; the staff, from the front desk to roomkeeping were extememly pleasant and accomodating. since we had our two daughters with us, we booked the traditional double room. the room was very nice with comfortable beds and a great view too. it had plenty of room for the four of us--or should i say five of us. the girls did not want to leave home without chichi, our teacup chihuahua. fortunately, the amabassador east allows small pets (with a pet waiver). that made everybody happy! the location is great as well. conviently located. easy to get to from lakeshore drive. close to the museums. i'm looking forward to my next visit to chicago. i'll be staying here again!
truthful	my husband, teenage son and myself stayed at this hotel last august. we were transferred there by tour operator who had sent us to a terrible hotel on the other side of chicago. when i complained i asked for us to be transferred to the sheraton which they arranged for us. i have stayed at many hotels in my life and this has been the best. the room (although i know it was not the largest) was beautiful and very clean with every amenity you needed. it also had superb views of the river and the lake. the entrance hall to the sheraton is so imressive as is the leisure centre. in fact all areas are fantastic. the best thing about the hotel though was the staff! from the bellboy, to the receptionists, the dining staff to the concierge - each one was courteous and so very helpful. one of the conciergies spent fifteen minutes on the phone trying to locate a specific pair of trainers for my son! above and beyond the call i would say! i cannot reccomend this hotel highly enough. the breakfast buffet cost about 10 dollars each but you could eat as much as you like and take as long as you like which we did!! it lasted us all day. if you have the choice of where to stay i think you will enjoy the sheraton! we did!!
truthful	having booked the hotel directly with the hotel on its website, i arrived tired from ireland, to find that they had mislaid my booking and had no room on that night, but did have rooms for the rest of the week. they booked me in to another (not as nice) downtown hotel and paid for my taxi to that hotel and for that nights accommodation. on my return to the hotel next day, i was upgraded to the club level. what really impressed me was that the hotel did everything they could to make up for their earlier mistake...unprompted. of course, the hotel itself (particularly on the 32nd floor) is excellent. i will definitely be back.
truthful	the james hotel met and exceeded our expectations. a haven of cool, uncluttered comfort in a hot, crowded but congenial city. located within steps of some of the greatest art, architecture, culinary and cultural opportunities anywhere in north america, the staff of the james provided us with a home away from home for the week we visited. the check-in was quick and flawless and the king suite a calm, restorative oasis. it is difficult to over-praise the friendly, attentive staff; this is a hotel that truly has its act together! the day before our visit ended, we experienced problems with the room's air conditioner. when the technician was unable to quickly solve the problem, we were immediately upgraded to a one-bedroom apartment with stunning views of the chicago skyline. we eagerly await the opening of new james hotels in other cities.
truthful	the palmer house has a beautiful lobby with a great bar and restaurant. the rooms are way too small!!! two people in a room with a king size bed can barely move around. not enough room for two suitcases. our room was very outdated-reminded us of the movie the shining. very noisy!!!! don't expect a quiet stay. you can hear everything that your neighbors are doing and saying not to mention everything that is happening in the hallways. we requested a room change as soon as we checked in. the room that we originally were in had a huge square cut out of the wall that had exposed pipes, bricks, dirt and dust. oh and the construction for their renovations starts at 7 a.m. during the week. we will never stay at the palmer house again. you are better off spending a few more dollars at a different hotel.
deceptive	i truly enjoyed my stay at the omni chicago hotel. we stayed in a suite, which was clean and extremely nice, at a very reasonable rate. my husband and i spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool, but personally i preferred laying out on the sundeck. service was excellent; they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown chicago area.
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers recently, and i was completely dissatisfied. when i arrived the clerk was very rude to my guest and myself. we finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room. there is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by. my bathroom was disgusting and not to mention, very small. i did not have a very pleasant experience at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers.
deceptive	this hotel was incredible! haven't had a better stay in a hotel in my life. i will definitely come here again next time i am in chicago! the rooms were so elegant, with their modern color schemes. the staff members were friendly and willing to lend a hand. the beds were surprisingly comfortable, with interesting covers. the tvs were hd, which was a step up from most hotels i have stayed at before. there was a cool martini bar that i spent an hour at one night, which was enjoyable, especially because of the live jazz band
truthful	the location was good. check-in was ok. asked for non smoking room, given floor with half smoking half non smoking. we could smell the smoke as soon as the elevator doors opened. we asked for and recieved a room on a non-smoking floor. they did not bring up the key, we had to go down to the lobby to get it. breakfast could have had some healthy choices, the sweet rolls and danish were not fresh. bananas not ripe. room only had one wash cloth, had to call down for more. housekeeping never showed up at our room. not for turndown service , not for the morning clean -up. called down upon our arrival back to our room after being gone all day and we were accused of putting our the do not disturb sign. they said they would come up and they never came when they said they would. we finally told them not to come because of the time. we wanted to get ready to go out for dinner. never greeted by anyone as we came and went. i have stayed at the peninsula and the burnham. the burnham was booked during our stay or i would have stayed there.i will never stay at this hotel again, not worth 300.00 a night
truthful	we stayed at the james hotel for a 40th birthday. the location was excellent for shopping and restaurants, but also very loud. the room was horrible. very small. we had a double/double and it was the size of a college dorm room, plus completely white walls and linens. absolutely no color except for one accent pillow. it was very sterile and uninviting. we were on the 11th floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting. it looked like the entrance to hell, if not a haunted house. staff was very nice and accomodating. i would not return to this hotel.
truthful	stayed for a week last month. can't beat the location - close to the magnificent mile, attractions, tours, great restaurants & night life. have spent a lot of nights in other homewood suites hotels and other suite hotels. thought the room was ok, not great. overpriced in my opinion. found staff to be uninterested and not very helpful. had to wait in the lobby on the 6th floor for room to be ready and the front desk staff could care less. watched during the week as other guests were made to wait as well. breakfast was the same stuff day after day. as the week went on, they actually started to run out of the more popular food items and these were not replenished (weekly delivery i guess). also, the room was was so busy that the staff made people wait for a table and treated you as you were waiting for a 5 star restaurant. travel for work (sales) and frequently stay in hotels. travel with family every year and also stay in hotels. this is roughing it for me...not a camper. would come to chicago again, but would not stay here. there are too many other options worth investigating.
deceptive	"my husband and i stayed at this hotel the weekend of sept. 17-18, 2011. when we were planning our vacation, we were impressed with the hotel. the exterior is very lovely and we looked forward to enjoying the view from our room. we first started to wonder if we'd made the right choice when there was no one waiting to help us with our bags. we had to carry our luggage up to our room ourselves as the hotel was in the middle of a shift change. this seems like something a supposedly ""world class"" hotel should be able to avoid. the good: our room did have a nice view and when i sat down on the bed it was like sitting on a cloud. the shower was very pleasant. the bad: the room was very small and the bed was not the king size we had requested. we felt very cramped and uncomfortable throughout our stay. we have stayed at less luxurious hotels that were much more spacious and able to provide us with the requested size bed. the restaurant options were acceptable, although the service was not as excellent as described. perhaps we expected a miracle that would've changed our minds about the hotel. we were so disappointed by the room and the service at check-in the rest of the weekend was somewhat tainted. we usually enjoy partaking of room service, but we decided after a sub par first day we would eat out for the rest of the weekend. next time, we will look into other hotels in the chicago area."
truthful	"we reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay. after checking in and unpacking, we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed (supposedly during renovation). the front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all 4 of us check into the room. colleen, one of the managers, was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem. we ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed. we never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently ""absent from the hotel"" during most of our stay. we stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence. we had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology. the lack of training of the staff was clearly evident, as was the cavalier attitude of the management."
deceptive	wow! that is all i can say! my girlfriends and i recently went on a little 'excursion' to chicago for a girls weekend and we stayed at this beautiful hotel. the rooms were beautifully decorated in a comfortable, modern style. the beds were so comfortable and cozy with the softest bedding i have ever felt on a hotel bed. our views were just as amazing. we could even see lake michigan from our suite. we only dined in the hotel once during our trip, but it was the best time we had. the aria restaurant was so elegant yet fun. very clean and just a great atmosphere. the staff was extremely professional and courteous, going out of their way to ensure our stay was a pleasure from the moment we walked through their doors. highly recommended! a must see next time you visit this area.
deceptive	my husband and i recently spent 3 nights at the ambassador east hotel. we will never stay at this hotel again. for the steep price we paid to stay there, we expected a friendly staff and clean room, which we did not get. first of all, the rooms are not clean. we found a few bugs in our room and the sheets did not look like they have been recently changed. when we reported this information to the hotel staff, they did not do anything to help us out. the staff is very unfriendly. also, there were no clean towels to use in the bathroom.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it. it is so conveniently located close to navy pier and michigan ave. the staff was very helpful and the room was great. it was definitely worth every penny! i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago.
truthful	first room's heating system sounded like we had a generator in our room. second room had stool in the toilet and a smear on the linens (which we didn't notice until morning-eeewwhh!). the computer, scale and ink pen didn't work. the maintainance man took 30 mins to come unplug the toilet and dripped to toilet water through bathroom and on carpet. this room was quiet and the bed/pillows comfortable. the bath was large and water warm.
truthful	we didn't stay in the hotel a lot because we went for the sites not the room. saying that, we picked this hotel because it was the cheapest but the hotel not having any parking we spent money on parking our car than what we could have spent on a better more expensive hotel with parking. hotel is great for guys getaway weekend that won't have a car. not a family frienly hotel. dining tip: long walk from hotel gino's pizza is a must have!! worth the walk. many things in between hotel and gino's to do so you can break up the walk.
deceptive	the hilton chicago was amazing!! it is close to almost everything that chicago has to offer! we could walk to lake michigan, grant park, niketown, watertower place, etc. the rooms were very nice and refreshed every day. also, they allow pets!! you don't have to go far to get good food because they have a few different restaurants right there! overall experience was an a++.
deceptive	when i first looked at the hotel monaco chicago - a kimpton hotel's website, the hotel looked very pleasing and a great place for me to stay during my visit to chicago. the problems began when i called to make a reservation. the woman who answered was very rude, to say the least. i had a few questions about the spa services. she rushed through what sounded like she was reading through a brochure. i decided that i shouldn't let one person ruin my experience with the hotel so i made a reservation and soon i was in chicago. the front desk service was very pleasant when i arrived, and the room seemed clean, other than the mysterious stain on my bedsheets. i got dressed up and went down to the bar area for a drink and appetizers. it took over thirty minutes for any worker to approach me for an order. yet two other parties that walked in after me were served right away. i was baffled considering i was dressed nice and in a fairly good mood considering it was my first trip to chicago. needless to say i will not be staying at this hotel again.
deceptive	i accompanied my husband on a business trip to chicago back in september and we stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel. the place was absolutely oozing with old-fashioned charm! also, there were plenty of shopping opportunities within walking distance, so i shopped while my husband worked. it just doesn't get any better than that! i loved the service we received and the ambiance of that grand old hotel, and i'd definitely stay there again!
deceptive	the atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable; it has a very modern feel. the rooms were very well designed, and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means. the pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable.
truthful	my wife and i stayed at the james recently and we had a great experience. the hotel as others have mentioned is in an ideal location. it's in a quiet location, yet so close to many neighborhoods that you want to go to. we upgraded to a studio room which was totally worth the additional cost. it didnt have all the midcentury furniture that the website photos have, but it was elegantly appointed, spacious, and as we were on the inside of the building very quiet. the service was amazing. everyone was extremely friendly and helpful, as well as knowledgeable. this was true from the doormen at the front, to people at the desk and the servers in the restaurant. both concierges that we dealt with had great suggestions, and were able to understand our style and sensibilities when helping us out. the breakfast at prime downstairs is among the best i have ever had in a hotel, this goes for the room service as well. dinner there was good, but not great. i mentioned almost flawless, as there was a situation that occurred involving the spa in the hotel. it involved scheduling and was aggravating, as the hotel actively encourages its use. however, caroline who is one of the hotel managers did an amazingly competent job of making sure that we were satisfied, following up on progress and was a true pleasure to deal with. the experience could have left a very bad taste in my mouth but was resolved quickly. overall, we left extremely satisfied with our stay and look forward to many future visits.
truthful	the historic feel of the hotel really had a strong influence on my choice to book this hotel. unfortunately, the ambiance of the hotel could not make up for the rest of its shortcomings. the front desk staff was rude, the doormen were usually busy chatting or playing on their cell phones instead of greeting us or opening the door. there are three elevators but good luck with them all working. they are very very small and when only one is up and running...you end up waiting a long time for one. not fun when you are on the 12th floor. the room was tiny and the air conditioning did not work at all...the room felt damp and miserable. we put the thermostat as low as it would let us (65) and the room never went below 78. (and it was 107 outside the whole trip!!!). there really are no amenities inside the hotel other than an ice machine and a slightly overpriced restaurant. internet is not free either... overall, i would never stay here again.
truthful	we stayed at this hotel in february 2010. the room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for united way. so we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity. we were woke up at 3:00am in the morning by a group of at least 25 young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor. of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours. they were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on. we called the front desk who sent security up immediately. security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave. we called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down. because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted. when we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate. well we still paid for it!!. they would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had. we would never stay at this hotel again, obviously they really don't care about their guests.
deceptive	on my recent weekend stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel, i was very disappointed. i chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area. from the look of the website, my expectations were above average. i felt the website led one to believe it was upscale. upon my arrival, i checked in. i was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room. as i was settling into the room, i began to notice a general lack of cleanliness. i noticed spiderwebs in corners, and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom. also, it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room, however, it did not work and i had to call down for them to bring a replacement. i, as a guest should not have had to call down, these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in. i found the restaurants on site to be crowded, loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal. i did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items. overall, my experience was not good and the next time i am in the area, i will chose another hotel for my stay.
deceptive	hi, i had very bad experience with this hotel, as the rooms had bad smell and very dim light. the bed sheets were not properly cleaned. also the carpet was dirty though ac was working properly. but i would nor recommend this hotel to my friends as it did not satisfied me. there was a problem with hot and cold water in the bathroom. please do not go to this hotel, it seems very nice from the pictures and all but in actual its different.
deceptive	"the hyatt regency chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they're staying in a nice hotel as soon as they enter the lobby. in other words, come here for the looks, not the amenities. they make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process.... you know, because a simple washing machine just isn't good enough. to me, this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being ""rich""--which most of them are not. meanwhile, the hotel doesn't even offer free wireless--an essential feature for business travelers like me. obviously i'm not the intended consumer, though, so i guess i shouldn't be surprised."
deceptive	i've stayed at several different hotels in chicago but the james is the best. everything i need is in walking distance and i find it very convenient to stay there. the staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly. the room has always been very clean. the bed linens are better that the nice sheets i have on my own bed. thankfully i don't have to search around for somewhere to stay when i travel there as i've found my favorite.
truthful	we wanted a nice place to stay the night after dinner, theater, and my daughter's 21st birthday. this place certainly fit the bill. it was convenient to everything including the southshore railroad station. the staff were all friendly. their was a small wine reception in the lobby in the evening and starbucks coffee in the morning. ryan, the concierge, ordered flowers for my daughter and had a nice bowl of hershey kisses waiting for us when we arrived. we were upgraded to a suite and although they forgot to make up the sofa bed, they came promptly to get it set up when we called later. the window seats were beautiful as well and i enjoyed drinking my coffee in the morning and reading a book.
truthful	"i checked into this hotel, rm 1760 on 11/13/2010. next day, i woke up with bed bug bites, numerous, on my arm and back. we reported this to the management who assiged us to rm 1901 and promised to get the room inspected and ""taken care of"". i insisted that they get all my clothes laundered, which they did. interestingly, no one from the management, other than the security guy who came when we first complained, even offered any apology for the inconvience. i missed couple of meetings that day. the next day, i called as i forgot something in the previous room, only to discover that the room was already assigned to the next guest. so much for reporting!"
deceptive	"the international chicago magnificent mile is shrouded in glamour, but underneath the facade fades away. the ""classical architectural landmark"" should be translated to ""old and boring. i found this hotel via google and have regretted it ever since. room size was small and unaccommodating, and that was one of the newer rooms! everything was free except for the gym (why that wouldn't be free with the price i paid i don't know). this hotel is overpriced for the quality and size of the room that you get, and i would not recommend staying there."
truthful	i would not recommend this hotel. although it is in a good area, the room was very small and is getting rather dated. the room had extensive damage. the paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling. the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling. the wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on. there was mold and stains on the bathroom tile. the room was very small. there was not room for a sofa. just a small faded chair and ottoman. the carpet had stains on it. also, the bed was comfortable, but there was not a top sheet, just the bottom sheet and a comforter. overall i was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged. i have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space, cleanliness, and value for the money paid.
deceptive	i stayed three nights recently at the hilton homewood suites- downtown chicago. overall i can't rate this establishment highly. the person at the front desk was disorganized- and took over 10 minutes even to find my reservation. once i finally got my key, the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me. it didn't get any better when i got to my suite. the bed was poorly made, and i found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows. the room was very stuffy, and i swear might have even had a vague pet smell. my shower was not very clean- notable hard water stains on the shower door,and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip. also, the carpets didn't seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable. i also visited their small gym/workout area and was disappointed there also. it had limited equipment that was in poor repair. the floor in there was even slippery, which made it a definite trip hazard. while the indoor pool looked good, as i dipped into it, the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell. all in all, the amenities, the unfriendly service, and the sub-standard cleanliness makes this hotel one i would definitely not recommend to anyone. when that is paired with their sky high room rates, it's just not a place that should earn any repeat guests.
truthful	we stay at hilton for 4 nights last march. it was a pleasant stay. we got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms, the tv was ok, a 27' crt flat screen. the coincierge was very friendly when we need. the room was very cleaned when we arrived, we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was ok also.the main hall is beautiful. the breakfast is charged, 20 dollars, kinda expensive. the internet access (wifi) is charged, 13 dollars/day. pros: low rate price, huge rooms, close to attractions at loop, close to metro station. cons: expensive breakfast, internet access charged. tip: when leaving the building, always use the michigan av exit. its a great view.
truthful	i stayed here for business and loved it. got it for $93 inc tax on priceline, an incredible deal for this hotel. if i wasn't on priceline i would expect to pay $200 per night (maybe more) for this location/level of service. it's in the heart of downtown chicago, walkable to many locations. the lobby is very impressive, the room was very nice. no complaints at all, from check-in to check-out. i was alone so didn't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves. it was full of people all the time. i want to stay here when i come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city.
deceptive	this hotel was gorgeous! i really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future. the staff was friendly, the room was clean, comfortable and very well decorated. the restaurant/ room service was also exceptional. the food was delicious and the room service was prompt. this hotel is also in a great location. it is close to everything anyone may need, such as shopping, food and attractions.
deceptive	staying at the swissotel in downtown chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience. not only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions, but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal. there are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food. the rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find. finally, the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance. overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for more than the typical hotel.
truthful	"i can't recall another time i've had to deal with such rude front desk help. while pleasant initially, as soon as i demonstrated the slightest bit of frustration that i was still waiting to claim my luggage for check-in (i arrived prior to check-in time, so they were holding a few bags), the true quality of this establishment surfaced. never mind that the luggage wasn't sent up to our room in the afternoon or that i waited in the lobby for 15 minutes at 7:30pm still looking for my luggage or at least a bellhop. while that was a bit annoying, the worst part was witnessing the poor attitude of donna, the very attractive but aloof front desk employee. her lack of initiative was only matched by her pettiness, as i noticed she refused to make eye contact with me for the remainder of my stay, including when my family came down to the lobby the following morning. i also booked a rate that included parking, which donna acknowledged at check-in but at check out billed me separately; i assume after i got on her bad side. even with my last polite good bye to the front desk, i felt a phony, uppity attitude from donna, and i really can't convey the extent of how insulting it felt. i can honestly say it was the worst part of my first trip to chicago. the hotel is well appointed and the lobby was small but cozy. great location as well. to be fair, most of the staff seemed very friendly, and i am not so obtuse as to not recognize my rating of this hotel is a statistical outlier. but i think most travelers, like me, would trade a few amenities for consistent and reliable service, so as to not have a ""situation"" that could single-handedly ruin a travel experience. unfortunately, that was the case here."
truthful	"if you have not tried the millennium knickerbocker for a stay in chicago, do it now! we have stayed (and enjoyed) at the drake, intercontinental and others, but we always now come back to the knickerbocker. why? if ""charlie"" the doorman is on duty and you pull up, he will welcome you. he'll probably ask your name. why? because he wants to call you by your name every time he will see you during your visit. somehow he even lets the other employees know your name and all of a sudden, doorman, receptionist, bellman, waiter are referring to you by name. the employees are what makes this hotel. yes, it has everything to offer like all hotels, but the others don't have the fine people (including the cleaning staff) these folks have. try it, you will like it. we look forward to our next visit already..."
deceptive	i stayed this hotel for 2 nights. i had high hopes seeing as this is a 4 star hotel and seems quite elegant based on pictures i've seen. upon entering the building, you can easily see that it is clean and high class. the lobby was nice, and everything seemed as it should be. however, as soon as i made it into my room, it was completely different than everything previous to it. it was dirty, visible yellow stains on the walls and all around the restroom. the room too was not completely organized as all other hotel rooms i've been to. there was also a lingering smell from the last tenants. when i called the front desk about these issues, they sent someone up to fix it. i left the hotel about two hours and upon returning, they were still at it! this is an unreasonable amount of time to fix these glaring errors. the smell also did not completely disappear when they were done. as i was too tired, i just decided to deal with it for the rest of my stay here and focus on enjoying my vacation at chicago instead. i hope its shallow exterior does not fool others like it fooled me.
truthful	we booked this hotel for the second leg of our chicago stay..it was great!!!! the lion king package was pricey but reasonable, given the ticket costs and the suite. room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. nytimes and chicago tribune at your door every morning. one block from the washington el train station. we never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like, but the suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. dunkin doughnuts and corner bakery down the block. city hall, picasso structure....this was a great place. book it and also use the golden touch limo service...reasonable. omar is a super guy.
truthful	at the last minute, my son and i decided to take a quick trip to chicago to see the cubs. after checking priceline i decided to book the omni because of the great price for airfare and hotel. we arrived at the hotel around noon and our room was ready(i had called ahead and requested early arrival).the front desk treated us like we were there best customers-very friendly and accomodating. the room was wonderful with all the modern conviences you would expect in an upscale hotel. the room was spotless and the bed was very comfortable. there was not one sign of bed bugs as mentioned in a previous review-maybe those bed bugs were from their luggage and were transferred into their room!!!we then went to the hotel restaurant and had lunch. our service was great as was the food. we also tried several restaurants around the omni-all within walking distance. the service, cleanliness and location of the omni were incredible. we will definitely go back.
truthful	stayed in old tower. room was nice and room service was very good. room wi-fi was expensive as was the bottled water. for the price of the room, at least there should at least have been water. i would rate the value as sub-par. the restaurant menu was not great, food mediocre by comparison to other downtown chicago restaurants and the service was below average especially since there were only three tables in use in the entire restaurant.. in summary, i will go to the m... or h... next time. some of the above comments are based on a previous week resort stay on the outer banks of north carolina and earlier this year in northern california. p.s. if you are a fitness room user, the $16 per stay per person is a good deal at this hotel.
deceptive	hello, i recently stayed at the affinia hotel in chicago, and was very unhappy when i learned of additional charges upon arrival. when i made the reservations over the phone there was no mention of any internet or parking fees. when i arrive i'm told fee to valet park is $49 per day, plus another $10 for internet. this is just plain ridiculous, and will remember not to stay here in future. there's too many other fine hotels that don't charge these fees.
truthful	i try to stay at the james every time i happen to be in chicago. there are other good choices in town, but nobody has what the james offers: superior service - aka class meets efficiency -, metropolitan design and comfort with an attention to details i found only at the w in seoul, and what always plays a role meaning a convenient location ... then they get to you with small unexpected touches that make the difference ie: i was about to take off and drive north, it was a hot july day...one of the staff members handed me a bottle of water. a small gesture. unexpected and appreciated. the management and the staff understand what we expect and more importantly, what we need. and they consistenly execute against that.
deceptive	pleasant staff and housekeeping. above average breakfast. the rooms were clean and the staff made sure we had fresh linnens. it was bedbug free!! i would definitely stay there again.
truthful	i stayed here with a dozen of my friends, and more than half of us got eaten alive by bed bugs! we stayed there from september 28 - september 30th, but the symptoms (i.e. the crazy itchiness) didn't come until sunday night when we all got home. i complained to the hotel and basically all they're gonna do is cover the cost of our dry cleaning bills. honestly, they should reimburse us, because it was not worth it at all. do not stay at this hotel!!!
truthful	my wife and i just returned from a 3 night stay at the amalfi hotel in chicago and enjoyed everything about the hotel. most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space, great jazz cd's in the room, wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds i've ever slept in. the staff was very helpful with every request. the amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry's, fruit's and jucie's. we also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta's for their guests. would highly recommend this hotel.
deceptive	my wife and i stayed at the allegro this weekend while i was on a business trip. i was very impressed with their hospitality and my wife very much(maybe too much) enjoyed the in-house spa. rooms service was a bit slow but, overall great hotel would stay again.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel. it was my first time staying at this hotel and, i am sorry to say, it was my last time staying there. one of my main issues with this hotel was the amount of noise. the walls must be very thin because lying in bed at night i could hear my neighbors in the next room talking. although i could not quite make out the words of their conversations, i could definitely hear their voices as more than just a murmer. in addition, i was awakened several times by people conversing in the hallway as they walked by my door, presumably on the way to their rooms. admittedly, i am a light sleeper, but this was ridiculous. if you decide to stay here, i suggest that you check your bill very carefully before check out. when i checked mine, i found that i was being charged a rate higher than the one that i was supposed to be charged. i had to wait in line at the front desk for someone to help me (and the front desk service is woefully slow) and finally had to ask to speak to a supervisor before the error could be corrected. finally, though i had been told upon check-in that my room had been recently updated, i cannot believe that statement was accurate. the room appeared to be rather dated in its furnishings and decor and the carpet appeared to be somewhat worn. all in all, i round my stay at this hotel to be disappointing. next time i will arrange to stay elsewhere.
truthful	for a supposed 4-star hotel, i was not very impressed at akk. the lobby was nice and modern-looking, but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors (we didn't arrive that late at night). additionally, when we walked into the hotel late one night, there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and, it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in. where was the staff to clean up? that's not a very welcoming sight. the rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view, but the actual location was farther than i would have preferred from michigan avenue, andi it was also a little too far south. area recommendations rush street was a lot of fun at night!
truthful	the omni is in a fabulous location on michigan avenue. within just blocks are all types of stores, including saks, nordstroms, h&m, filenes basement, macys, la perla, apple, bloomingdates.....i could go on and on! the room itself was fabulous. comfortable, nice big flat screen tvs, nice sized bathroom. they charge for wi-fi, but we found if we clicked yes on joining their guest program we could then go from the sign-on screen right to our email without actually completing the registration. we got this hotel for $214/night through priceline and felt it was a terrific deal!
deceptive	my wife and i stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. the atmosphere was very chic & upscale; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. my wife even got to bring along her dog (aka #1 man!). i would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to anyone staying in the chicago area.
deceptive	i recently made a business trip to chicago, in which i stayed at the downtown fairmont hotel. during my visit, i had an aroma-harmony massage. this experience greatly relieved my stress, from all the business meetings i'd had that day. candace worked wonders for my neck muscles, especially. this was the only amenity that i sought out, during my trip. my time was very limited. however, the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if i were a valued guest. i'll definately stay at this hotel again when i'm in the area. and, i highly recommend the spa!
deceptive	"i had never been to chicago and was looking forward to sightseeing after my business conference. my company had arranged for me to stay at the omni chicago hotel located in the center of the magnificent mile. once i arrived at the hotel and gave it the once over, i was pleased but not impressed. once i put down by luggage and inquired about my reservation. i was told that my room was not ready yet and that there'd be an hour delay. i tried not to lose my temper and pleasantly asked if i could have another room. i was told there was a convention going on in the hotel and every room was filled. i would have left, but my company had a account at this hotel. if i stayed somewhere else, i'd have to pay out of pocket. the service employee behind the counter flippantly told me to take a seat and went back to talking with his gum-chewing co-worker. i picked up my luggage and plopped down in a cushy chair that wobbled. the leg in front on the left side was broken. i picked up my luggage and moved to another chair. two hours passed by before i was given my room. when i walked into the room the first thing i smelled was cigarette smoke. i was mad because i explicitly asked for a ""non-smoking"" room. i was furious. i didn't feel like going back downstairs and dealing with the idiot behind the counter and i was tried from my long flight. i sighed, tipped the bellboy and slammed the door to my room. i thought maybe i could use the air conditioning to freshen the room. when i went to turn it on, it didn't work. tired and angry, i went to sleep, thinking i'll never stay at this hotel again."
deceptive	we planned a fun time for our kids this summer by booking a kids suite at the swissotel chicago. our fun time was not exactly that. upon arriving for our weekend getaway, we find that the reservations we made online and the confirmation we held in our hand for a kids suite, did not mean a thing. apparently, there were none of the kids suites available. the kids suite is supposed to have things to keep the kids happy when they are in the room: coloring, video games, etc. no one at the front desk could explain to us why there were no kids suites available. whatever. so, we took a regular suite with the promise that we would be moved as soon as one became available. guess what? we spent the whole weekend in the same room. yes, the staff apologized, but no one seemed overly concerned that our children were dissapointed and no compensation or extras were offered to make us less cranky about it. other than that and the fact the none of the hotel staff was very friendly, the rooms were clean. we did not spend a lot of time in the hotel, but i will not be booking a room here again. the staff did not impress me at all and we did not feel like we were treated well at all.
truthful	we booked our room on priceline, and got a good deal at around $100 per night. we stayed for the first 2 nights of our us trip so didnt use too many of the hotel's facilities the hotel is centrally located, just over the chicago river from the shops at north michigan avenue, and around a mile from navy pier our room was clean and comfortable, and on the 29th floor we had a good view of the city, and could just about see lake michigan (though the weather was very bad). the layout of the room is a little peculiar, with the bed facing away from the window, but over all we have no complaints about this hotel, and unlike some other reviews we were not disturbed at all by noise from other guests so, pros and cons: pros: helpful and friendly staff clean and comfortable throughout spacious rooms large and airy public areas starbucks and gift shop in lobby cons a large hotel, so a long walk from the elevators to the front desk / lobby area
deceptive	my family and i were in chicago for a friend's wedding. we had asked around to find a hotel that was nice, but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the intercontinental chicago hotel. the hotel appeared very nice, and to have all the amenities: room service, wifi, clean rooms. unfortunately, as it turned out, appearances can be deceiving. it begins at the desk, where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring. he said they didn't have any rooms available because we didn't make arrangements. it was getting late, and we had no place to go, there weren't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving. i asked if there was anything he could do, and he said that i will have to ask someone else because he was busy. i talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing, the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night. apparently, our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard, because this room wasn't even clean and the wifi didn't work. we ordered room service, and it never came, even after several complaints. it doesn't end there either; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service. overall, this was a very frustrating experience, and i wouldn't stay there again.
deceptive	i expected a bit more from the hyatt regency chicago i stayed at recently. i was appalled of the conditions of the room we stayed in. the linens were not clean, the toilet paper roll was nearly empty with no spare left, and there was a lock on the door that didn't function. the turndown service left me no chocolate on my pillow and i think they took a few more pieces of the already nearly empty toilet paper, again with out leaving a spare. i would not stay there again. traveler beware!!
deceptive	i just returned from a long weekend in chicago with my wife. we stayed at the affinia hotel and i can't even begin to describe what an awful experience it was. when we arrived at 4pm on thursday (check-in is 3pm), our room was not ready. we had to wait til almost 5pm before we could even get into the room. once inside the room smelled like an ash tray. obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room. we decided to just go out for an early dinner. after arriving back to our room around 9pm, our key didn't work. we had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one. the next morning the maids started knocking on our door at 7:30 in the morning! why would you try to clean the room that early??!! the 'do not disturb' sign was on our door for the rest of the stay. after that early wakeup, we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned. the front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when i asked. eventually we did get a new room but i didn't enjoy the demeanor i encountered to do so. our new room was fairly nice, and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful, but i have a bad taste in my mouth and likely won't stay there again.
deceptive	"our trip to chicago was a complete delight despite our stay at the affinia hotel. because their rates were actually higher than we were used to in new york city, we naturally assumed we would get a nicer establishment. we could not have been more wrong. this place focuses on gimmicks to set themselves apart from their competition. uunfortunately, it does set them apart but in a strictly negative way. both the ""dream pillow menu"" and the ""experience kit"" were a complete flop. with the ""dream pillow menu"", the hotel offered patrons what seemed to be great pillow choices from down-stuffed to hypoallergenic selections. we happily chose the fluffy down pillows but when we got to our room and laid down on them a giant poof of dust came out. at first, i thought it was my imagination so i stood up and hit the pillows on the edge of the bed. more dust came out them! particles were flying around the room, i'm now sneezing and there was this disgusting grit all over my sunglasses that were sitting on the night stand. i called the desk and they sent up replacements for all the pillows. these pillows were some kind of ""music pillow"" that pluged into an mp3 player. i was sleeping on uncomfortable cords all night. in general, the staff was pleasant and tried to be accommodating, but there was just no apology good enough for filthy pillows. another failed gimmick they offered was the ""experience kits"". we were given (ours to keep) a collection of some maps (which were actually very nice), a walking tour guide that was all marked up, and a handy deck of cards opened and missing two cards. if this place lacked attention to detail, that is one thing, but it lacked any attention at all. if the pillows weren't already enough, at this point i was certain that i would never stay at this establishment again. run, don't walk away from this place."
truthful	we recently completed our second stay at the fairmont chicago. the check-in process was quick and painless but the front desk staff was almost disinterested in the whole procedure. that is fine when i am traveling on business, but on leisure trips i would appreciate a warmer greeting. the hotel was hosting a convention at the same time as our stay, but other than seeing some signage/attendees in the lobby, we wouldn't have noticed. this is probably due to the separation of the conference areas from the guest rooms and the 8 speedy elevators. we stayed in a parkview suite so we had a large room with a great view of millenium park. the anteroom was well appointed with a sofa, coffee table, desk, mini-bar with sink and coffee maker, and dining area. the bedroom appeared to be the same as a standard fairmont room, but maybe slightly larger. the bathroom also appeared to be similar to a standard fairmont room, and once again, possibly slightly larger. the upscale modern decor is pleasing but not overtly luxurious, and several small touches such as a shoe shine station (with extra collar tabs), are peppered throughout. we booked a few evening activities through the concierge and everything was perfectly handled. the hotel restaurant, aria, couldn't find our reservation but they oddly new my name and remembered that the hotel had called to make a reservation for us. they had no problem seating us and the dinner (both food and service) was lovely. minor complaints: the pillows could be better. i'm not sure if they remembered our preference for non-down bedding from our last visit, but seriously, these things barely felt like pillows. i'll suffer through some congestion if i can get better neck support. also, the valet parking attendants seem overly eager to take your car (and charge you $49). and as i mentioned above, the front desk experience could be improved. best feature: after our first stay, i gave a brief review in the comments section of the fairmont president's club (membership is free) website. i received a phone call from the director of rooms the same day asking to discuss our experience. after this stay, i left a comment essentially thanking the hotel staff for a great stay, but still received a warm, friendly phone call from the director of rooms asking if he could do anything to improve our next stay. kudos to the fairmont for taking its customers seriously, and for that, they've won my loyalty.
truthful	my wife & i celebrated our anniversary at the knickerbocker & could not have been treated better. before we were out of our cab, our bags had been loaded on a cart & we were walked into the hotel by a doorman. the rooms were well appointed & the entire hotel staff was very friendly. this is a prime location for shopping, sightseeing or nightlife.
truthful	visiting during a busy 2day conference in chicago. most hotels booked solid. the full hotel allows you to meet a wide array of customers. everyone is complaining about service, cleanliness, and overall experience. location is good. hotel is tired. employees surly. too many cool properties to choose from in this town, will never stay here again and will re-think hilton in general
deceptive	"i arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend. when i get there i noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in. ten minutes later after standing there with my suitcase, the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software. she told us to wait until the computers booted back up. i asked if i could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they couldn't activate the cards. finally another 20 minutes later the computers were up and i finally got my room. wheres the ""luxury"" in waiting 35 minutes for a room? they also need to change the name of the hotel because their service did not leave me ""allegro."""
deceptive	the sheraton chicago hotel and towers was everything you could ask for in a hotel. it was meticulously clean, very orderly, but still perfectly warm and comforting. the rooms are very big and spacious, and the beds are so soft, it's like heaven! i didn't test out the room service, but i'm sure it would be just like everything else... perfect!the hotel staff are just so nice. there was a spectacular view from my room, and looking out over the city at night is so magical. there are resturants that are easy to access from the hotel, and i especially recommend shula's steak house. overall, i had a fantastic stay at the sheraton hotel, and i would definitely stay there again!
deceptive	this is a great place to stay while visiting chicago. my husband and i went over the holidays to see my family and we stayed at this hotel. we could not have asked for nicer people! everyone was always smiling and very helpfull! we usually stay at the ramada...but will never stay anywhere other than the intercontinental chicago hotel again! - casey l. skinner
truthful	we booked this hotel using points on our credit card. when we arrived, we were immediately greeted by a friendly face. we arrived several hours before check-in. however, they let us check-in early. they also gave us a free room upgrade. the hotel is absolutely stunning! in addition, it is off of state street. there are many things to do - shopping, dinning, theater. it is also close to public transportation if you would like to go to the united center or the airport. the hotel also allowed us to have a late check-out at no additional charge. the room was so dark and quiet we slept in.
deceptive	my stay at the hotel monaco recently was fantastic. we got a very reasonable price for our stay (especially since we were a aaa member), and there was plenty of perks to utilize; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few. another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that, upon request, the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room. how cool is that! the staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable. i would definitely recommend the hotel monaco to anyone in the downtown chicago area.
deceptive	"my recent stay at the talbott hotel in chicago was miserable. my visit began on the wrong foot when they couldn't locate my reservation. i had my reservation code and the email confirmation but they insisted they couldn't find me ""in the system"". we finally agreed to scrap that reservation and start over. that process was lengthy as they were training a new girl on how to take reservations. the room that i had originally reserved (king) was not available and i had to wait 45 minutes for them to clean a double room. i was so tired from the traveling and the hassle at the front desk that i decided to stay in and order room service. it took an hour and a half for my food to arrive. when finally delivered, it was cold and not exactly how i had ordered it. so now i am cranky, tired and starving! i ate what i could from the mini bar (poor selection of items) and went to bed. the room was spacious but had a stale smell to it, as if someone had smoked in it. the next morning i complained and wanted to change rooms. the woman at the front desk couldn't be bothered with me and didn't try to make things right in any way. i decided to check out and go to another hotel for the remainder of my stay in chicago. i will never waste my time or money at the talbott again."
truthful	i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in mid-march and was so disappointed with everything. the room was small, the carpets in the looby were smelly, no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows. not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days. it costs $10/day to connect to internet. if you want to use internet in the lobby, minimum charge is $5 per use. to use the phone in the rooms for local calls, it is $1.25/15mins and then 10 cents every min. even the local calls are charged, what a rip off!!! every hotel i have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast, of course no such thing at this hotel. no indoor pool, go figure. i won this from bidding process at priceline, i will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future.
truthful	"stayed for 2 nights at the james, wonderful location 2 mins walk to michigan avenue with all the shops. staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly. nothing was too much trouble. rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable i have slept in. room was very clean, had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a 42in flat screen tv. there was a bar area with stereo, mini bar and coffee maker. there was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area. bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo, conditioner, shower gel and body lotion. hotel is also ""pet friendly"". there was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel !!!. pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu."
deceptive	elegant and modernized hotel with great staff. location is wonderful. the health club located in the hotel had everything needed to get my complete workout. i will be staying there again due to the wonderful experience and decent prices.
deceptive	my stay at the hilton was like living in luxury for a few days. i never wanted to go back home much less leave the hotel. during my stay i could work out in their facility and swim at no added charge. in fact, they didn't charge for wifi, morning breakfast or their grocery shopping service. the lobby always had complimentary coffee, tea, soda and meals! i felt like a queen. this hotel deserves highest marks for service.
deceptive	overall, the hotel was okay. though i did have a problem with the price. the accommodations mentioned on the website were accurate (other than the supposedly luxury mattress, it was not more comfortable than my own mattress!); but this hotel offers nothing more than a much more affordable hotel! there is a difference between the palmer house hilton lobby, and your normal, affordable lobby. but, i do not go to a hotel because it has a fancy lobby; i go to get a good night's sleep. when i want to sight see, i go elsewhere. like i said, overall, the hotel was okay; but it was not worth the price.
deceptive	"we decided to stay at the james last weekend with our kids. we reserved the ""family adventurer with paul frank"". it's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium. we ended up receiving 2 chicago city passes, which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the chicago children's museum. my kids had a ball. we ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored. all in all, a great weekend where my kids were the focus. the adults certainly weren't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning."
deceptive	i recently had the displeasure of staying at the conrad chicago. although the hotel came with some recommendations from various online websites, my experience was anything but pleasent. first of all, they tell you that check in time is at 3pm. well i arrived at the hotel at 3:30pm and checked in only to discover that my room was not ready. after waiting for nearly an hour for the room to be ready, i decided to go settle in. the carpets in the room smelled old and musty. additionally, the bathroom was not in the the cleanest of states and there were numerous noticeable chips, scratches, and dents in the furniture. although the bed was comfortable, i just couldn't get over the musty smell coming from the carpet. it was very difficult to get the air conditioning to set a comfortable temperature and i did not have a very good nights sleep. all in all, my experience was not the worst i've ever had, but far from anything worth writing home about.
truthful	when we were stranded in chicago for two days since our flight home was canceled, our airline put us in touch with hotels.com who found us the room at the sheraton towers. after a long and frustrating day that ended up with us still in chicago, arriving at the sheraton was a joy. the entire staff was wonderful. the bell staff was great helping us (finally) let go of the heavy bags, jonathan at check in was very helpful and had us in a room which he upgraded for us in no time. we enjoyed the location and the facilities of this property during our unexpected stay and would highly recommend this location to others. we can't say enough about the staff. if we are in chicago in the future we will definitely return here!
deceptive	stayed at fairmont chicago millennium park and it was not a good experience. the room had been cleaned in a haphazardly fashion and was not pleasant to walk into. when i called the service desk for more towels to be brought up into the room, it took an exceedingly long amount of time for them to be brought up, and the woman who delivered the towels was as rude as can be. will not be staying at fairmont chicago millennium park again.
truthful	we had a reservation for 3 rooms with 5 adults and 2 kids, got only 2 rooms on arrival. 2 of the corner rooms with an extra room. during the night it was very cold and we were not able to change the a.c., even though we switched it off, it went on cooling, strange! at night it was very loud from the street. in the morning they uploaded something infront of our window and i stood vertically in the bed, not what you need, if you only spend 1 night in a hotel. we came here a few years ago and had it better in mind. the area is in good walking distance to all famous shopping places, very good. clean and fancy. sorry, but next time we`ll be looking for a more quiet hotel in chicago.
truthful	this hotel is trading on the hilton name and although adequate the decor is dated and depressing. although classed as a three star the prices do not reflect this. it was more expensive than other four star hotels in the neighbourhood, the breakfast is poor quality and the room very crowded. all in all the worst hotel we stayed at in a 14 day tour of canada and the usa. would not stay there again.
deceptive	my stay at the hyatt regency was an experience that i'll never ever forget - not in a good way. check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant. i went up to my room and looked around, all seemed ok at first. i was bushed so i flopped on the bed... ohhhhh noooooo! the bed was as hard as a military bunk from my army days. but i was so tired that i just passed out. of course i woke up with a back ache...great. i figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so i plugged the tub, turned the hot water on full force, and poured in some shower gel. i put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm. i called the front desk but they were no help, the clerk just apologized. frustrated at this point, i turned on the tv and switched on the air. i put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and i saw something slimy inside of the vent. it looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something. i couldn't take anymore of this. i went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk. it seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized, no empathy as if he's used to hearing about the goop in the ac. he offered me a free night but there is no way that i'd stay at this place again - ever.
deceptive	the hilton in chicago was awesome. the room was very clean and the hotel staff was very professional. one of the features i liked, was that in my room the internet access was wire and wireless, considering my laptop is not wireless, it help me out alot. food was very good, quality was great. there was also a flat screen in my room...awesome. the hotel itself is locaated in the middle of alot of resturants with fin dinning. i also enjoyed the gym very much. overall, i enjoyed myself, and i will stay again at the hilton when i return to chicago.
truthful	stayed at the monaco on my way skiing at easter & loved it. staff were helpful & friendly, room was huge with fantastic view of the river. central location, 5 min walk to the el. adjoining restaurant/bar, great food & service. i have stayed in more expensive, supposedly better, hotels in chicago, but this is the best. thanks monaco, i'll be back.
deceptive	"whatever you do, do not stay at the homewood suites in downtown chicago. i made that mistake, and it was terrible! the bed linens were obviously not clean - there was even a stain on the comforter - and the housekeeping staff there absolutely did not care about doing a good job. our room was only ""cleaned"" twice in a week's stay, and even then only the barest minimum of effort seemed to go into it. they didn't even empty the trash cans! as for the ""in-suite"" kitchen, it was awful. we were hoping to save money by cooking in our room, but with one broken eye on the stove and a nasty, greasy microwave? it seemed a better idea to eat out, and avoid any more unpleasant surprises from their lackluster in-house food. i didn't hear good things about their breakfast offerings, anyways. if i were you, i'd avoid this place like the plague. i know i'm certainly never going back!"
deceptive	my visit to the conrad chicago in the heart of downtown was a luxurious experience bar none. the lobby is immaculate and is filled with reams of class and style. the rooms are beautifully adorned. i especially like the flat screen tv and wired internet. i'm never happy with wireless connections so it is nice to find a hotel that knows that its guests need fast, reliable internet connectivity, and it's included at no additional charge. the view from the room was magnificent...downtown chicago at night! the restaurant is spectacular but the terrace is the place to be when weather permits. you cannot get a more breathtaking view and be able to relax in the gentle breeze of evening while dining on the finest gourmet foods. don't forget to visit the health and fitness center with their selection of aerobic and anaerobic workout equipment. the staff is attentive to your every need and the concierges can get you whatever you need. just ask! this is the place to stay in chicago if you want to be pampered in luxury!
truthful	as a regular visitor to chicago and a freuent guest at the ambassador east, i was exceptionally disappointed during our last visit. room service has been eliminated despite the renowned pump room being located in the hotel, there was no in-room directory, the carpet was torn and stained, no phone book, the refigerator and honor bar had been removed, and the room was so small i had to turn sideays to get past the bed and the armoire. i asked the desk clerk about larger rooms, and he said they were all the same except for corner rooms - which is untrue, as there are several larger room types. he didn't even offer to check availablity of other rooms! in talking with the consierge, she blamed everything on upcoming renovations - which the hotel has been promising for more than two years. all in all, a very disappointing, and expensive, experience.
truthful	check-in was fast, the room was perfect, and there were no problems. this is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable. i got a very good deal for a one-night stay, but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet. if you are bored of the routine hotel fare, walk two blocks to gourmet pantry (155 n. michigan) for a refreshing change.
truthful	if you are looking for a hotel that is truly in the best location, the intercontinental is it--right on the magnificent mile, next to the chicago river, across from the wrigley building. my daughter and i stayed here for a getaway, and quickly were able to get to milennium park, shopping, navy pier, great dining, exploring festivals and strolling through beautiful areas along the lakefront and chicago river. check-in was easy and we were treated with courtesy throughout our stay. maria, one of the concierges, was especially helpful in finding us a unique place to eat. the room was lovely and comfortable, although our tub didn't drain well. just a wonderful stay!
deceptive	me and my wife recently stayed at the hilton chicago while on vacation, and i can't recommend it enough. the hotel is located right on michigan avenue in downtown chicago, and right next to tons of great restaurants and stores. the rooms are spacious and elegant; they are modern and stylish without being crazy or garish. i especially liked the big flat screen tv and the very comfy bed, sleeping in hotel rooms is often far from relaxing but i had no problem falling asleep. i highly recommend the hilton chicago, i'll definitely stay there again. a+
deceptive	we stayed at the beautiful millennium knickerbocker hotel located in scenic downtown chicago. it was close to shopping, local attractions like the shedd aquarium and even the navy pier. the hotels featured luxurious amenities like a ball room and in room massages, which i took advantage of as any woman (or man) should! a continental breakfast is available for a nominal fee, unless purchased with a package deal, in their own upscale restaurant, nix! we would definitely book a suite there again and highly recommend this hotel to all our friends and family!
deceptive	during my latest business trip, both me and my wife recently stayed at the omni chicago hotel in chicago,illinois, at one of their deluxe suites. unfortunately, and i think i speak for both of us, we were not fully satisfied with the hotel. the hotel advertises luxury-level accommodations, and while the rooms resemble what one can see in the pictures, the service is certainly sub-par. when one plans a stay at such an establishment, they expect a service that goes beyond having fresh towels in the bathroom when they check in. first of all, the air-conditioning in the room seemed to be in need of a new filter and when it was first turned on, the air coming out seemed musty. second of all, the fitness center was only open until 10:30 pm. for people who like to exercise after dinner, this can certainly be a problem. especially considering that it does not take much to have the fitness center available around the clock or until midnight. for these, as well as other similar reasons, i would not recommend this hotel, if one is looking for luxury accommodations.
truthful	"my husband and i did not enjoy stay at hotel allegro! the room was so small. the bathroom was ridiculously stupid, everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself. truly one person at time in the bathroom, it was like being in an airplane's bathroom. the walls are so thin, we heard the people across hall having sex. the some staff were really rude. i did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out. check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8am with the sign stating "" do not disturb. "" the hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms, no mini fridge, and no coffee maker either. no drawers to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny. we were there for four days and three nights, so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at. i also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car. my husand and i will never stay at hotel allegro again!!!"
truthful	for a hilton hotel i was very unimpressed, the rooms are incredibly small, there are no refrigirator or coffee machine for coffee or tea. wifi costs an arm. plus side there is a starbucks at the bottom, but only limited opening hours, the lobby is very nice. location is decent.
truthful	i was very happy with my stay at the knickerbocker. the room were nice, and the staff was excellent. i was able to stay here for $80 per night thru priceline. that was an incredible bargain in my opinion .. this hotel is very nice. it has an excellent location ... just off of michigan ave. all of the best shopping in chicago can be found right around the corner. it's a great location ... very close to many great attractions. if there is any negative it would be that there is no swimming pool, but i think that is common with a lot of the older hotels in chicago, i would definately recommend this place ... hopefully i will be able to stay there again in the future.
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago hotel is absolutely magnificent. the rooms are of utmost standard and you get treated with such respect. the staff is always there no matter what. not only is the hotel beautiful but it surrounded by beautiful lights and beautiful skyscrapers. i give it two dumbs up. if you are ever in chicago the intercontinental chicago is the place to stay.
deceptive	the affinia manhattan is fantastic! my husband and i stayed there when we went to visit my sister. i loved the room. it was one of the best hotel beds we have ever slept in. the view was incredible. manhattan is one of the most beautiful places i have ever been. the staff was very helpful as well. they had no problem going out of their way to be helpful. i would suggest this hotel to anybody!
deceptive	my wife and i stayed at the conrad chicago hilton a few weeks back. i had a conference in the windy city, and my wife decided she'd come along to do some shopping. first off let me say, typically i love staying in hotels - any chance i get, i'll spend it away from home in a comfy hotel bed. that said, this place was terrible. the room had a slight odor to it, kind of a fishy smell. the people at the front desk were rude to us. and i found a soiled pair of women's panties under the bed. gross! not to mention that once we got home, we both had bug bites up and down our legs--- now we're worried we brought bedbugs home with us! if i could take this trip back i would. what a terrible place. shame on you conrad hilton, shame on you!
deceptive	this hotel is fantastic. i stayed there on my way through chicago towards arizona, and could not believe the great quality of the hotel. i'd have thought i was in a vegas suite. really polite staff, great housekeeping, and amazing prices. on my way out, i was telling the manager about how much i'd loved the hotel, and he even offered me an extra night there! you can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly 24 hours.
truthful	we stayed here from nov. 30 to dec 2 and had a wonderful time. the hotel is just beautiful and the service was excellent from check in to the maid staff to the bartenders in kitty o'shea's. we had a room with a king bed that was very comfortable and had very nice feather pillows. you can request other types if you have a problem with feathers. the large flat screen tv was very nice. bath products were by crabtree & evelyn and included shampoo, conditioner, mouthwash and bady lotion. plenty of coffee was provided. we drank and had snacks at kitty o'shea's. the crowd was fun and there was live irish folk music each night. good selection of beer and good shepards pie, cheese dip and crisps! the location worked very well for us. we walked to the art museum and buddy guys blues club is right across the street. and shopping was a breeze using the shuttle! the cab ride to the museum of science and industry was quite far though and cost about $15 each way. an excellent weekend getaway!
truthful	just got back from a 10 day visit to chicago. for the rate of $219 per night, it was extremely good value. reception staff were efficient, courteous and very friendly. i was given a room on the top floor (32nd floor) facing the lake and the john hancock tower. the rooms were large and very comfortable. housekeeping/turn down service were efficient and thorough. bathroom amenities were very good and replaced daily. this is definitely my first choice for a hotel in chicago. it is also very close to all the shops, restaurants and the subway.
truthful	this hotel had a great location, but you can do much better for the money. the hallways smelled of smoke, dirty elevators, furniture in the lobby was thread bare. the staff was very helpful. the room was large, bed comfortable but the room was so musty and old smoke lingered. if you have any allergies don't stay here!
deceptive	i would never stay here again. for a hotel that calls itself a four-diamond hotel, it cannot even provide the most basic amenities and services. i would have been more comfortable staying in a run-down motel. the bathroom had not been cleaned properly and the sheets were stained.
deceptive	"i was very unsatisfied with my stay at the allegro. the front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window. after giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet. this came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began. after waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested. we were informed that they were ""only requests"" and not a guarantee. room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed. when we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted. the food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasn't exactly right either. this is not the kind of service i expected from an upscale hotel."
truthful	we needed an extra night in chicago after a gratus stay at the penninsula and won a skyauction bid for the james @ $203. this is one of the nicest hotels that i've ever stayed in. bathroom aside, we felt it equalled the penninsula in comfort and level of service. i echo all of the superlatives previously written and would love to stay here anytime i'm in town.
truthful	i recently stayed here for the chicago triathlon. this was my third stay at this hotel. i have not had any issues until this visit. after the 3rd day of my stay i requested my room to be serviced and returned to what i thought was a clean room. while getting out of bed i was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet. i must not have been the first person to be cut in the room because i found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards. i had not noticed it before so i was very disgusted. we notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped. we returned to the room after 5pm to find that the dried blood was still on the floor. after making a complaint to the customer service i have gotten no reply from the hotel. considering the price point of this downtown hotel i would think that they would try to live up the 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably. luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown chicago.
truthful	i stayed at the fairmont during a professional conference. while i have to say that for a conference, some of the meeting rooms were too small, in terms of traveler's comfort the hotel is exceptional! i can't think of a single thing about my room that wasn't perfect. the accommodations were luxurious and the hotel is conveniently situated within walking distance of many chicago attractions.
truthful	we visited for my 40th birthday. we had never been to chicago so was not sure where to stay. found the deal on this hotel from travelzoo. great rate, staff was awesome, very helpful and nice, location was great. enjoyed our stay but still like nyc better. great, great hotel. would stay again.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the palmer house hilton on a business trip to chicago. i will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do i have to stay here. when the reservation was made, an early check-in was arranged -- due to travel arrangements, my travel companion and i were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning. we had arranged an early check-in without having to pay for the night before. there was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine. when we got there, however, there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags. we were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place, and cart our bags around with us. they offered insincere apologies and didn't offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience. the rest of the stay (one night) was nothing to praise. i guess not having bugs would count as positive? i would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here.
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the affinia hotel in chicago, and it was one of the worst experiences i've ever had at a high-end hotel. i was in chicago for a conference, and i thought i would enjoy the experience more if i had somewhere pleasant and relaxing to return to, but this hotel definitely wasn't that place. the restaurants were mediocre at best, despite their high prices; i repeatedly got food that was bland, overcooked, or lukewarm. the room was fine, but nothing special; i think i'd have been just as comfortable in almost any hotel in downtown chicago. a big part of my discomfort and dissatisfaction with the hotel, though, was with their jet set pets program; it's hard to find a decent, relaxing hotel that i'll like that will also accept my dog. but many of the employees were rude about my adopted mutt, who is energetic and loves people but isn't the most photogenic dog - he has a scar on his face and he's got that terrier look. multiple people mocked him, or said there was no point grooming him, or asked why i wanted him sleeping on a bed in my room. i know that it's a fairly high-end hotel, but i would hope for better service regardless of the class associations of the dogs. i hope they at least treat all of the dogs boarded there well. the experience was overall frustrating and unsatisfactory, especially for the price. i can give them good marks on their spa services, and i really appreciated the pillow ""menu,"" but other than that it didn't feel like a particularly luxurious or indulgent experience, especially given the customer service."
deceptive	what i hoped would be a pleasant stay turned into a nightmare. the first sign of trouble at the affinia was that they couldn't find my reservation. add to that the room service delivered cold food after a long wait and the mini bar was not well stocked. the internet service was so slow it was unusable. to top it off the street noise seemed to penetrate the thin walls with ease making getting a good night sleep nearly impossible. finally, i discovered the valet parking, which was a $49 premium service, dented my fender and scratched the door paint on my car. i highly recommend going elsewhere when you visit chicago.
truthful	i was initially very excited to be staying at the ambassador east hotel. the photos online appeared very classy and upscale and i thought staying there would be a pleasant experience. upon arrival i was very disappointed - the main lobby was closed for construction making it somewhat difficult to get around. our room was very dated - old furnishings and linens, damaged tile - it fell quite short for the high price we paid. it is an older building with very thin walls allowing you to clearly hear all other guests in surrounding rooms and also the lovely slam of doors of departing guests in the morning. doorways are extremely narrow in hallways and room - gives a very claustrophobic feel to the hotel.
deceptive	the fairmont chicago millennium park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels i have stayed at in a while. at almost $500 a night, one would expect. traveling with my wife, i expected to pay the cost of the room, already being outrageous, but then i was hit with another $20 charge for her to stay. even with a king bed, they only figure in one person to their cost. the beds were average and although there was much to do, everything cost an arm or a leg. it was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away. all in all for the amount of money that i was paying on a per night basis, if i was in chicago for any longer than that one night, i definitely would have stayed somewhere else. i guess you live and you learn, its just a shame that i had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations.
truthful	beautiful hotel, but doesn't have a lot to offer for the price. sheets and pillowcases in the room had stains on them, tv remote would not function properly. valet service truly needs improvement. we payed quite a bit for overnight parking, and it took them almost an hour to bring our car to us when we needed to leave. when we asked to find out what was taking so long, we got tossed back and forth between bell hop and front desk, with no answers.
truthful	a lovely hotel in a trendy part of chicago which gives it a much more comfortable feel than the downtown hotels. the rooms are very, very well appointed, but not large, and the quality of the materials is wonderful without exception. unfortunately, the service was below average in every way: they failed to deliver laundry by an important and assured deadline; valets didn't deliver the car and had to be asked twice; the concierge gave us miserable directions that got us lost, and the front desk was unable to rectify any issue. it amazed me that so much incompetence could happen in 6 hours! and even after recognizing their shortcomings, not one sincere or significant apology. a poster child of how bad service cannot overcome a well-built, well-furnished hotel.
deceptive	this hotel was everything we were looking for. my mom and i were on a girls weekend out shopping trip and just needed a place to stay after a long day out. the talbott hotel was incredible. the rooms were very clean and spacious and had everything we needed. the hotel check in was easy and the guest services folks were awesome! they even gave us tips on great restaurants in the area. highly recommend this hotel on your next trip to chicago!
deceptive	i loved staying at the hard rock hotel in chicago, not only is it an amazingly friendly atmosphere, but they give me the option to bring my pet with me. they are a dog friendly hotel, it costs $55.00 a night for the dog to stay with you, but that beats the costs of paying a kennel to keep or your dog or a neighbor to watch them for you. i loved this option. they also give your animals a gift bag filled with treats, food, bowls and doggy clean up bags. i higly reccomend this hotel if you are looking for a place to bring your four-legged friend with you when you travel.
truthful	my husband and i stayed at the hotel monaco for 5 days in october, 2007. i cannot begain to tell you how great this place is. the service was impecable and the room was fantastic. huge window seat to look over chicago. it was great. the wine reception in the evening was a special treat as was the morning coffee service in the lobby. this was our first trip to chicago and i hope not our last. i will definately stay at hotel monaco again when we return. we booked our room through a safety convention web site.
deceptive	during my stay at the hilton chicago it has been quite unpleasant. how so you might ask? well ill tell you, the towels where scratchy and the service was terrible and by terrible i mean they weren't even at the desk when i checked in. also, when i ordered my breakfast, lunch, and dinner from room service i received the wrong order for all meals and felt a little sick after lunch. finally, the bill was charging me for stuff i didn't want or ask for. but overall the hotel was very bad and unpleasant for me and others. i give it a half a star.
truthful	"when you're standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all, nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again. the worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem (they told me that it happens to the upper floors, and i wasn't even staying on the highest floor!) as if that makes it ok. i can look past the ""rustic"" decor of the room and take it for what it is - an inexpensive place to crash, but c'mon, a girl's gotta shower."
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel was in one word, dreadful. the hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic. the service is terrible. if you want to wait for your room for 3 and a half hours this is the place to go! throughout a whole week, beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned. the hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit, they give no info for any activities going on in chicago. this hotel should be listed in the top 10 worst hotels in america. do not waste your time nor money staying at the omni chicago hotel.
deceptive	my stay at the hotel monaco chicago was amazing. the staff are polite and well poised, eager to give a helping hand in a short notice. to someone like me, who had never even been in the city of chicago, it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip. the rooms, hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy, and whenver i went out, i would always find my room perfect ; be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences, or just to hit the mattress and sleep. during my stay, i stopped at their restuarant where i had one of the best american style meal in a while. overall, the hotel monaco is a place i would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit chicago for a second time. it is truely exceptional.
truthful	"we just returned from a weekend at the palmer house. we normally stay north on the mag mile but wanted to be closer to soldier's stadium and the art insitiute this time. we were able to upgrade to a suite upon arrival at half the price that we paid for a regular room at the four seasons two weeks earlier. what a suite!! it was huge. the basic living room, dining room and kitchen/wet bar area was one large room. up to three additional bedrooms can be added by the use of connecting doors. all rooms were spotlessly clean. they even smelled good. lovely soaps, robes, etc. lots of large closets. the bathrooms were older but well maintained. much better than the ones at the four seasons. the furniture was nice but worn in some spots. the beds and linens were excellent. room service was fast. the food and service were great. the pool and workout areas were clean and well maintained. we had one small problem with a burned out lightbulb in one of the lamps. maintaince arrived quickly with a new bulb. they wouldn't allow me to tip them!! check-in was somewhat slow as the hotel has been sold out for several weeks. this is a very large hotel, so they have to move a lot of people and rooms. also, the hotel does not have views as it is configured like an ""e"". all in all, the palmer house is a good value for the money."
truthful	"i have stayed at the james a few times, it is my go to hotel in chicago. this last trip makes me think it is time to start looking for other options. the good: location is awesome, just off michigan ave, trader joe's across street for some healthier snacking. it is a great location, easy to walk most anywhere. the door staff are very friendly and helpful. the overall feeling is modern, upbeat. turn down service with cookie is nice. free wifi (which worked to varying degrees throughout stay) the bad: they claim to be a 4.5 star hotel, which to me, means better then a 4 star and online with a 5 star (without a pool). they used to have kiehls toiletries and now have ""harmony"" brand. additionally, they now have the large bottles attached to the wall which you get to share with the other guests that stayed in the room before you. it is what i would expect from holiday inn or my gym, but not a 4.5 star hotel. i asked about the switch (mainly because when i booked they still had kiehls in website description) and they claimed that the reason they went the communal bottle route was to be ""green"". that is hard to believe, as it's not like the hotel is making other efforts to be green (they still have incandescent light bulbs, housekeeping leaves the lights and radio on when they do turn down, they don't recycle in room, etc). they are obviously trying to cut costs, and it shows. more: the rooms are in need of some updating, they are looking somewhat tired. my third floor room was quite loud with the motorcyclers trying to prove their manhood out front (not their fault). don't take the stairs (as the stairwell is straight out of horror movie), even though the wait for one of the two elevators might be awhile. the phone staff was fairly rude (granted, they didn't like me questioning their toiletry change). i feel bad giving such a low rating, but it really did not come close to my expectations (from previous stays there). i will start trying out new hotels in the area."
deceptive	the james chicago hotel was one of the worst hotels i have ever stayed in. the only good thing about it was that it was located downtown, so i wasn't forced to stay in it any longer than i had to. the receptionist was rude and snobby, my room had dirty towels in it, and i found numerous small insects in my room. furthermore, the gym and spa were closed while i was there. nothing was done by management to accommodate me for these inconveniences. next time i will take my business elsewhere.
truthful	"this hotel is a shambles-furniture literally falling apart and a staff that is both rude and uninformed, nevermind the lack of security and the absence of the so-called amenities. the ""fitness center"" is an oversized closet! we were appalled during our stay! truly anticipated ""warm, irish hospitality"" and short of a barman, no one was irish, warm or hospitable! manager was unresponsive to our needs and front desk attendent was incredibly rude when we made a simple request. her manager (?) refused to come out of the office when she called to ask them to speak with us. room was pretty at first glance but when dresser drawers fell out and the major construction of the hospital next door began at 7:30am it is not the kind of experience anyone could tolerate. to call this a red roof inn would be an insult to rri! the manager that finally called us back was soooo fake and insincere that we would have prefered no call at all. the only thing they have going for them is the location but its not worth the trade-off."
deceptive	"while the hard rock hotel in chicago promises upscale accommodations and a unique experience, they fail to deliver. unless of course, a unique experience includes being kept awake all night by a party in the room next door. if you plan on staying there for a chance to meet your favorite celebrity or musician you will be sorely disappointed. the ""a"" list celebrities will not be there. in fact, it would be rare to find anyone on the ""b"" list either. the party that keeps you awake will not be your favorite band practicing for their next concert. the party is being held by the musicians that were not even able to gain work at a local coffee bar. the walls of the rooms are so thin you can hear every wrong note played. as for the promise of art deco, it must have changed in definition. your room will truly look like a concert has just been held. the carpet smelled like it had been shampooed in beer. the bathroom lets just say that clean was not the correct description. quality service and amenities were severely lacking. guests are not greeted with warmth but with disdain. do not bother complaining about the noise next door either. it is part of you unique experience. the only part of the hard rock hotel description that appeared to be accurate was that it is in a great location in chicago. it was easy to find a real hotel to stay in for the rest your trip."
truthful	the elevator system was impossible. it seems they were trying to improve it but only made it worse. many people waited 15+ minutes and some bailed out to the stair wells. it happened several times. i had read about it before booking but guess i didn't take it seriously. it'd be a deal breaker for any future return unless i heard clearly it was improved. also, i always think it's lame that you have to pay extra for wifi. area recommendations north michigan avenue and lake front areas are best.
deceptive	this hotel seems to take everything about luxury and force it down your throat. the first place it attacks you is directly inside of your pocket. this place looks alright in the lobby, but when needing a place to stay during the midweek for a convention or to just sightseer in chicago, this is far too much to spend on a place to sleep for a night. clearly the ambassador east hotel has not taken into account that we are in a recession. not to mention that it is at least 30-40 minutes from the airport in traffic. chicago traffic is stressful enough without having to worry about how quickly the airport can be reached, particularly if the front desk forgets to give you a wakeup call.
deceptive	my family chose to stay at the chicago hilton during our last trip to the city. we wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices. i can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the hilton. the staff treated us well, the rooms were clean and roomy (we loved the serenity beds), and the hotel itself is stunning. it was like stepping back in time. we loved that the chicago hilton was close to numerous attractions. the weather was lovely, so it was great to walk to navy pier, sears tower, and the adler planetarium. we will definitely stay at the hilton the next time we are in chicago.
truthful	excellent hotel ! rooms and service were great. a great value ! i have been to places that are not as good for nearly twice the price. good location. close to the l and short walk to rental car service. restaurants in the area a bit of a disappointment, but the shopping was great. area recommendations great theatre, restaurants, museums and shopping.
deceptive	the hyatt regency chicago is a wonderful hotel. :) me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation, and it couldn't have been better! the staff was very polite and helpful, and the rooms were very clean, and they had some of the best beds i've ever slept on! not to mention the view was amazing! if i had to rate this hotel i'd definitely give it five star, next time i'm in town i will most definitely stay there again!
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hotel monaco and i must say, it has become one of my favorite hotels in the windy city. in the past, i've always stayed at the marriott or the hilton so this time i thought i'd go with a boutique hotel. i've stayed at some of the kimpton properties in san francisco so i was delighted that they are running the monaco. basically, i like the friendly, real-people atmosphere as opposed to the corporate style places i've used before. i do work out and they had a decent fitness center with the treadmill i normally use. south water kitchen served a terrific meal even in a city of great restaurants. i really dug the complimentary coffee, high speed internet and newspaper. i get tired of being nickel and dimed by the corporate hotels and liked the fact that the monaco offered a bunch of freebies -- especially liked the afternoon wine service. all in all, i will return to the monaco. it's a great alternative.
truthful	my husband and i were there for a conference and had booked the room thru their website, when called to confirm had us down for only 1 night instead of 4, easily changed. first morning cold,cold shower, didn't complain,next day fine. phone did not work, called every day to complain, and every day said it would be fixed when got back to room, never was. no dial tone, unable to call restaurant, or call for car or call for room service. finally, on last night someone came to our room while we were there and did fix it. the hotel is beautiful, rooms great and everyone was so nice, even when i was complaining they were nice. great gym area also, and love the restaurant. but, for the money i could easily find another hotel just as nice with a working phone.
truthful	we absolutely loved the knickerbocker. now, if you expect your hotels to be cookie cutter comfortable, forget this place. if holiday inns are like the rows of housing developments in the suburbs, the knickerbocker is like those beautiful old houses in the center of the city. the location is great, the hotel bar is cozy and classy, and the rooms feel like guest bedrooms in victorian mansions. for the price, you simply can't do any better than this in downtown chicago.
truthful	my initial thought of the hotel was, this place is just ok, i didnt look up any reviews as i was staying there with 2 other friends. i was truly impressed from ceiling to floor with the room. views were good, its just the surrounding buildings unless your towards the front where the river is located. i'm crazy about huge bathrooms and this one is huge. i love all the space they have. flat tv, traditional seating and i admired the fabric-based headboards. those are very nice! walking distance to restaurants were convenient. i'm a highly frequent traveler to chicago almost 20 years now and always stay with relatives. in any event, i'd recommend staying at the monaco again!
truthful	my experiences at the fairmont chicago were less than desirable. i try to be fair when i write my reviews, but fair is not in the fairmont chicago language. from pulling up to check in i felt the gouging start. $54 a night for parking is terrible for this area $30-$35 is the average and that is not affordable as it is but $54 is just disgusting to put on your guests. the parking was more than my car rental. in the room the internet is not complementary it is $16 for standard and $25 for some sort of ultra upgraded internet service. gouge gouge gouge, who charges for internet anymore and even worse upgraded services. i didn't go online every day of my 8 day stay because of the cost. one update on the internet that they don't tell you upon check in is that if you sign up for the free premiere fairmont club you will receive free in room internet service, i found that out on the last day of my stay. other issues with this property is the shower pressure is not very good. the bed was hard and uncomfortable. and i would say there are many other properties that have a better location and price in the city. on a good note the aria resturant in the fairmont has a tremendous staff and serves up the best burger and fries i have ever had, loved the complimentary naan and dips to start, and the complimentary orange bark to finish.
deceptive	we will not be back to this hotel. there are several reasons for this, but it began at check-in when the staff were very rude and uptight. our reservation was lost in the system and they seemed to think it was a strain on their time to have to find it. the room was ok, but the beds were hard and uncomfortable. the room next door had their tv turned up very loudly, and when we called to ask if we could change rooms were were told that was not an option. they didn't offer any other solutions. the food in the restaurants was extremely overpriced and not cooked to our requests. overall, we wish that we had chosen a different hotel for our stay in chicago.
truthful	my friend and i stayed for just one night, and loved the hotel. it had an awesome water feature in the hotel, and great large bar. like all hyatts it had a very comfortable bed, lot's of pillows, and large bathroom.
deceptive	i had to go down to chicago one weekend for the graduation ceremony of my cousin. it was a sudden trip and i didn't even have the time to book a hotel before hand. when i showed up in chicago and asked my taxi driver to take me to the nearest good hotel, he took me to omni chicago hotel. i was impressed with how clean it was and they didn't have a problem with getting me a room even though i didn't have a reservation. the staff was friendly to me the entire time i was in the hotel, which was just a short two nights, and the cleaning service was top notch.
truthful	on our visit to chicago, we chose the hyatt due to its location in downtown, within walking distance to most major attractions, such as sears tower, magnificent mile, grant/millenium parks, etc. subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . overall the hotel was very nice, clean, and at a great location. was in a safe area. went to beautiful wrigley field and soldier field and saw both teams play. i love chicago and would defenitely stay here again!
deceptive	terrible time at the talbott. when i planned my vacation to chicago i called ahead and made reservations to stay here. when i went to check in i was told i didn't have a reservation, knowing my credit card was charged i argued with the guy who was working. finally the only option he gave me was to speak with someone else. thankfully they knew how to use the computer. i go up to my room and there was a terrible smell of beer and feet. i could not believe it when i complained, i was told to spray some air freshener. i had to go visit family. when i got back my room key did not work. once again there i was complaining to the helpless employee. he told me the magnetic strip must of came in contact with a magnet. i could not believe the mentality of this guy. i had one more night reserved, i could not take it anymore and i went and spent the rest of my vacation at my aunts house. i would not recommend the talbott to anyone.
truthful	i thought the swissotel was a great hotel. the rooms were very spacious and clean, especially for downtown chicago standards. most importantly, the rooms were quiet. i never heard people in the hallways when i was trying to sleep. the only downside was that the beds were not anything special. sure, like all hotels in chicago, this hotel caters to wealthy and/or business clients with ridiculous minibar and parking price. however, if you are aware of that prior to arrival, its not a big deal (ie finding a different place to park the car, bringing our own snacks for the room). it would be nice though if hotels such as the swissotel had a microfridge in the room for guest use. staff was very helpful. bellmen instantly got cabs upon request, and the front desk was efficient and helpful. overall, if i can get a good rate again, i'll stay at the swissotel the next time i am in chicago.
truthful	me, my sister and my best friend all went to stay here in the summer of 2004...they said there all spacious suites...yeah right...our room you could barely walk in...and they said theres 2 double beds...yeah well one was a pull out couch...and the bathroom...tiny tiny tiny...and it took forever and a day to check in and the people blamed us for throwing a book out the window and somehow someone knew exactly where it fell from and which room...yeah...i wouldnt stay here again
truthful	great expectations from the hotel of the fugitive! wonderful lobby! and that's it! the room was old in style and furnitures, the tv was from the other century, no minibar, no wireless internet, no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room, those guys ignore that we are in the era of ipad without cable connections. small room, small bathroom, rude service room. they have lost my credit card number and want cash on delivery for a breakfast of 20 dollars. robbery in the business center, 0,59 cents a minute for internet connection, you have to pay to use word, or excel. never again!
deceptive	"stay away from the hyatt regency chicago. i recently had to spend the weekend in chicago on business, and expected this hotel to provide an experience beyond that of some seedy dive in the bad part of town, but alas, i was left disappointed. i arrived in the afternoon, my flight having been delayed, ready to rest for a few hours before starting my evening. unfortunately, my room was not ready. it should have been ready hours earlier, but perhaps the inclement weather that had delayed my flight had also delayed the hotel staff. in any event, i was advised to wait in the bar, creatively named big bar. they seemed annoyed that i wanted only water, not seeming to understand that it was not by my own choice that i spent time in their hideously noisy establishment--i wanted only to relax in my room. i waited there for over an hour before checking back in at the front desk. was my room ready yet? 'what room?' they replied. to my astonishment, it seemed that i no longer had a reservation! how this came to pass, i do not know, and the boy behind the desk was certainly unable to enlighten me. i explained that i was simply waiting for my room to be cleaned, or furnished, or renovated, or whatever they were doing to make it ready, but my words were nothing against those of the almighty computer, who spake ""guest not found"" or some nonsense and who had the final say in such matters. i requested the manager, who was unavailable, presumably because the staff had not yet managed to get him ready either. finally, i admitted defeat and slunk out from the hotel, with fewer regrets than i would have imagined, to find a better place to spend the night--a park bench surrounded by pimps and thieves would have been more inviting at that point. as it was, i found another hotel, better priced, better staffed, and with rooms ready for my custom. so if you are looking an experience like no other, book a room at the hyatt regency chicago. if you want a place to sleep, look elsewhere."
truthful	we stayed here through hotwire and got an amazingly low rate- $60 some odd dollars nightly for a 2 night stay last may. the room they had us in was small and had no view of anything except the wall of the other part of the hotel, but it was very clean, tastefully decorated and cozy. we had a great vacation, walking all over town until we ended up near the planetarium which was where we then turned around and saw the skyline of chicago and were just wow. so anyway, the hotel is great, the service was great, the room was very nice- i would recommend this hotel to anyone though i work at the front desk of a hotel myself and the previous person's comment about how she wasn't able to get adjoining rooms, well, internet sites don't guarantee things like that anyway- you've got to call the hotel direct and verify things like that. there's a note about that on internet sites as well- no room type/location is guaranteed. 5 stars out of 5 for this hotel.
deceptive	"having come to chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days, the hotel allegro chicago filled every bit of my checklist. we arrived and immediately were checked in and shown to our rooms; we both had the ""double double deluxe"". the rooms were gorgeous, well taken care of, clean, comfortable, well decorated and luxurious. the hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn't even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day. the hotel has great staff, they were always attentive to our needs. my favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee - i am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great! stay at the hotel allegro chicago if you want great service from a relaxing and luxurious hotel in the heart of chicago's hustle and bustle!"
truthful	this hotel has a great location and nice infrastructure. the river north area is full of great restaurants and the north bridge area is great for out of towners. the decor is lovely and a nice hold-over from when this was a le meridian. while the conrad aspires to be in the top tier along with the peninsula, the four seasons, the ritz and park hyatt, it falls short. we and dinner at the terrace restarant outside the other day and were initially impressed with the setting and the selection. while the prices were similar to the peninsula, we figured that it was a nice day and worth a try. wow, were we ever disappointed. first off, we were told that we could have a seat but only stay until 7. ok, thats fine and we sat down. the waitress made a point to ask if anything was wrong, so that she could make it right. when we indicated that our glasses of champagne were not very full ($20 per glass), she consulted with the manager and then another manager (a heavier fellow in a dark suit). she came back and said that was the standard puor and that she would be glad to bring us additional glasses. what bothers me is not the outcome, but the fact that the management is not service focused. at a four seasons or the peninsula, this would never happen and if we expressed any displeasure, it would be made right. at the conrad, the terrace manager just ignored it.
deceptive	"if you want a 5-star hotel with 1-star service, make sure you book your next chicago stay at fairmont chicago millennium park. when i checked in to the hotel, i had to wait at the desk for over ten minutes with no line. i was greeted with no ""thank you for your patience,"" or anything similar. the room was fine, but nothing too glamorous or outstanding. the internet cost $14.95/day which is outrageous considering the price of the hotel itself. the thing that pushed me over the edge, however, was the valet parking. when i wanted my car in the morning, i had to wait 15 minutes to be acknowledged (the valets were talking to each other and ignoring me altogether). and for this ""service"" i was charged $51.00/night!!!! when i went to complain at the front desk, they just said that sometimes the valets get overwhelmed, and you have to exercise patience! i will exercise patience as i check out of this hotel!!!"
deceptive	my husband and i visited this hotel on our way home from our honeymoon. it's a very nice hotel, but the valet parking is very expensive, $53.00 per night was rather high so we opted to park our own car. the pool was very nice, and the water was warm. the front desk was very nice and helpful, if i ever visited chicago again i would stay there.
truthful	"i booked this hotel for a business trip since i was able to get a $129 rate on travelzoo and figured i'd save my company some money. i had also read excellent reviews on tripadvisor. i had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in november. when i arrived in chicago at 7:30pm i decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told ""no problem."" when i arrived at the hotel at 11:45pm i was told they didn't have a room for me and that i'd have to move to the four points sheraton which they paid for. it was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away. i was told that they overbooked and didn't get as many cancellations as they expected. i did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience. i would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check-ins or you might not have a room! the ""experience designers"" were great and very helpful. the rooms were very nice and comfortable (felt like home). the breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the ""healthy factor."" it was nice that they did have fruit. i think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel--they just need to get the basics down!"
truthful	so my sweetie lures me out under the guise of dinner at the china grill, upon arrival he tells me his boys are watching the game in a suite upstairs and want to say hi...we arrive at the 35th floor and my oh my!!! surprise!!! ladies and gentlemen this is something to be admired...spacious and roomy, yet warm, cozy and inviting...great bed, comfortable furniture, great 42 inch plasmas, and the views are unbelievable...my only complaint? a shower should have a door to keep the heat in...other than that no complaints, room service was great, morning coffee was yummo...overall a fabulous experience!!!
truthful	while the parking service was great - the front desk was terrible. we had a huge problem getting ice one night - we had none in our room so we went twice to get some - no one was there to help, called the front desk they promised to deliver some - none arrived so we called again - they said we had to come and get it and would not listen to what we had to say about what had already happened. ...read more
deceptive	if you are traveling anywhere near lake michigan within the next year or less, i would highly recommend staying at the sofitel hotel. unbeatable elegance, fine dining, and magnificent views are only just a few amenities to speak of. along with excellent service and reasonable pricing you will be assured to get a quality nights rest. if there were such a thing as a 10 star rating, the sofitel would surely have it. my visit and stay there was nothing short of elegance and comfort. located minutes from everything in downtown chicago, one would hardly want to leave. fine dining, dancing, and an evening bar will leave you absolutely relaxing after any meeting, or social event in town. the sofitel hotel will leave you wanting to visit the moment you leave.
truthful	"was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time.... 1. arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby... no warning. not on the website... ""thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site"" 2. lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area (25 min wait).. check in..ache conference-- be prepared for the influx of people for the convention. 3. double book room.... go back to check in... told to get back in line... and we will review when it is your turn... told them i just waited 25 mins.. curt service worker said wait your turn. 4. second room... dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3pm. 5. internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network.... 6. second day and third day stay... no hot water to start the day off with cold shower.... 7. check out... overcharge on bogus fees.... travel to chicago stay at the palmer house or fairmont."
truthful	in my experience the ambassador hotel didn't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment. the building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated. the carpeting was very old and worn. the floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable. i would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel. currently, it's indespirate need of renovation.
truthful	"we chose to stay at a small hotel because we did were looking for a hotel with less crowds. we anticipated we would get better service in a smaller hotel, than some of the other larger high rise hotels. we did not experience very good service at the talbott hotel. when we checked irena seemed very robotic and aloof. the front desk clerks were neither welcoming nor gracious. the lobby is small and the front desk is just a few feet from the front door. each time we came into the hotel we were never greeted nor even received a smile from the staff, just a blank stare and gaze. the front desk staff was chilly and stiff, no greetings, no smiles and no personality. they had difficulty answering simple questions or requests. on the other hand the bellman perry was great. he was sociable and very service oriented. he was aware of what is going on in the area. he recognizes the guests and he offered suggestions about things to do in the immediate area, and where to eat in the neighborhood. he is authentic and he even asked us upon our return ""how was that restaurant?"" tim the concierge was also supportive. he gave us 10% discount coupons for shopping at the major department stores. we had the largest suite. we requested a rollaway (extra charge) when we made our reservation and we had to ask five different times to have the rollaway bed delivered to our room before it came after 10pm. when the rollaway finally came we had to call back the front desk because they did not deliver a blanket or pillow with the bed. what made our talbott hotel experience most disappointing was that we may have never received any housekeeping unless we had asked to have our room cleaned. we were out of our room from 8am and when we returned to our room at 4pm the rooms had not been cleaned. we called the front desk to ask to send someone. the maid rushed to clean our room while we had to shower and change for the evening. the room itself was pleasant. it did have a moldy smell and some frabreez would have been nice to bring along since the windows do not open much. we were next to a noisy neighbor and the walls were thin. we really liked staying in this area of chicago but expected first rate service. the service was very weak and unacceptable for this class of hotel."
deceptive	located right in the heart of downtown chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip. the first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is, and how clean the rooms are (even compared to other luxury hotels) seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the terrace and get a drink, i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed, i've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones, once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent, bed was soft and the tv didn't appear burned out at all. overall i give this a five out of five, the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect, i wish i could have stayed longer.
deceptive	best hotel in an excellent location i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a business purpose. my 1 year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room. the front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly . the room service was also good. the room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good . i like the decor of the room. the french restaurant in sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining . i will surely prefer to stay in sofitel on a next time travel to chicago.
truthful	"my wife and i brought our daughter downtown for a blowout ""american girl"" weekend and chose the monaco because of it's glowing reviews. we arrived late and maybe that's when they put out their second-stringers, but we felt unwelcome by the desk staff--like we were an intrusion. i'll never understand this--they're in the hospitality business and they're inhospitable! (this is getting picky, but the reception desk which is cleverly designed to look like a vintage louis vuitton trunk needs some maintenance. the repeated ""hm"" initials are peeling off--looks like they used rub-downs where they should have silk screened for durability). when we got to our room we found the maid's ratty work shoes at the foot of the bed (yuck!). i'm still trying to figure out that scenario. there were no ashes--so i've ruled out spontaneous combustion. also, to the disappointment of my daughter, the much-advertised goldfish was mia. the bellhop (who apologized for the shoes) explained that they take away the fish when they turn down the bed ""...is that ok?"" he said. i think the proper response at a hotel like this would have been to bring up a stinking 35c/ fish to make a tired 5-year-old happy. on the up side, the rooms are nice and have an over-the-top decoration that my daughter loved (""i'd like to live here!"" she said). the bed is very comfortable--my wife wants the same brand now. the bathroom is nicely appointed with quality materials and good strong shower--except for the cheap fall-apart-while-you're-using-it toilet paper. come on kimpton! how much can a decent roll cost? the view towards the river is great (try to get one) and my daughter loved the upholstered wide ledge by the window--she closed the curtains and was in her own ""club house"" watching the world go by from from high above the city. in short: very nice hotel--desk staff at night could be nicer (wouldn't cost anything and would have made up for the maid's shoes!)"
truthful	the good location views decor room service friendly staff the bad shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked bed was just ok the ugly had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up. i am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotel's ipod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up. also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower. the staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately. also, they mentioned that they had aready been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers.
truthful	"when i called to edit my existing reservation, i was placed on hold for 30 minutes! finally someone came on the phone and said, ""ill have to transfer you"", so i was put on hold for another 5 minutes. when i finally did get to speak to someone, as i was going through my changes, i asked her to send me a revised copy of the reservation to which she huffed and acted very put off. before she was able to disconnect with me, i said ""i have one more question"" to which she replied ""i'm working at the front desk and i have customers waiting!"" i thought, so am i not your customer? pathetic and rude. hotel better find some better employees for their guests to truly enjoy their stay."
deceptive	my stay at the hotel allegro chicago was an amazing experience! the staff were helpful and considerate, always there to tend to my needs. my suite was extremely clean, and had all the amenities that i could ask for. i almost didn't want to leave my room, because it was so nice. but in the end i did, because the hotel is situated in such a great area, that i had to go out and see some of the sites. this hotel has wonderful rooms and service, and is in a really great area. i suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in chicago.
truthful	we got a great deal on this hotel, just $91 found through travelzoo. we only stayed one night, but were very impressed. the sevice was fantastic from the moment we stepped up to the property. the hotel smelled wonderful and was immaculate. our room, while not enormous was perfect. we had a great view of the city and lake. the bed was extremely comfortable. we never heard any noise outside of our room. the bathroom was nice sized considering we must have had one of the smaller rooms in the hotel, two could get ready very comfortably. location was perfect, just off michigan ave and steps away from millenium park. we would definetly stay here again, especially if we could get this great deal!
deceptive	the omni chicago is hands down, the best hotel in my opinion in the chicago area. i am a neat freak but here you need not worry about cleanliness as they are the best at keeping the rooms tidy. our check in was easy and fast and the staff at the hotel was very courteous and friendly. i forgot my hair dryer but thankfully, one of the many perks at this hotel, they provide one for you in your room! that's a small benefit compared to the lucious pool and dreamy massages they offer! i have never had a massage like that before! my favortie thing about the omni is the high speed wireless internet that is available to all guests. i am able to do my work online in all areas of the hotel which saved me a lot of time as i was not at my office but still had a lot of work to get done. i also loved the tv they provide in the room. a big plasma with a beautiful, crisp picture! i don't even have that at home! needless to say, i spent almost all night lounging in the comfortable bed watching movies only to fall asleep and wake up to the newspaper delivered to my hotel door in the morning! i will be coming back to the omni on my next trip to chicago. that's a promise.
deceptive	oh my! more like a dank museum than a four star hotel! i read so many reviews on this hotel that i was sure my husband and i wouldn't be disappointed on spending our 10th wedding anniversary in the heart of chicago at such a luxurious hotel! all the reviews sounded great so i feel awkward writing this, but i have to be fair - this place was a major disappointment. while the location is superb, the images online must have been taken over 10 years ago because all of the decor when we visited looked very old and faded. i noticed dirt everywhere - the fabric on the furniture was stained, the baseboards and woodwork were scratched and dirty and there seemed to be a smell of mold and mildew that permeated the entire hotel. even though the food was great, the linens, glassware and silverware were not sparkling - it sort of helped that candles were lit so i didn't focus too much on how dreary and washed out the dining facility was. i didn't realize experiencing history would actually mean staying at a hotel that's living in the past! this was barely a two star hotel and i do not recommend staying here at all.
deceptive	the hard rock hotel chicago is not as good as they try to portray, first ill start off by saying there website is confusing and hard to navigate through. they also have rude customer service, that dont seem happy to answer your questions. there prices are so outrageously expensive for what they offer, its just ridiculous. hard rock hotel has a good rep behind there name, but hard rock hotel chicago should not be included in that.
deceptive	"""classy"",""decent"" and ""serene"". these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago. the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel. the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle.the staff from the bell-boy to the managers were polite, helpful and responsive to my needs. the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home, making the talbott a home away from home. my wife and i enjoyed the t-rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer. believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids. it felt very safe. anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home!"
deceptive	for a hotel rated with four diamonds by aaa, one would think the hilton chicago would be almost like staying at a palace with royalty. the only royal thing about this hotel however is that it was a royal nightmare. i should have known from the moment i walked in with my wife that this was going to become a bigger headache than what it was worth. first off, as soon as we arrived to check in at the hotel with the clerk who couldn't be any older than nineteen or twenty, red flags started going up. the clerk was extremely rude and lazy, acting like it was a chore even getting up from texting on his cell phone. if that wasn't bad enough, the clerk pretty much ignored me while blatantly staring at my wife's breasts. she wasn't even wearing anything that could be considered skimpy as it was cold out and she was wearing a turtle neck sweater under a large fur lined coat. after diverting his atention several times we finally got our room keys. it shouldn't have been any surprise when we learned that there were no one to help us with our luggage as the clerk said they were all out on break. okay, that was annoying, but we managed easy enough. we finally got to the third floor where our suite had been reserved for over a month and we looked forward to resting after our long trip. to our surprise, not to mention our disgust and horror, their was already a couple in what was supposed to be our room on the bed making out. it took almost a half hour between the couple in the room, the front desk, and my wife and me to get it straightened out. apparently the night clerk didn't bother following policy as they had taken our reservation off the computer to give to their friends while leaving the printed card for the day clerk. after what could only be described as chaos, we were finally given another room on the next floor up. we were thankful when we got to it and my wife went to use the bathroom while i dropped our luggage by the beds. hearing a clinking sound i bent down to look what one of the bags could have hit to see an empty beer bottle sticking out from under the bed. i was about to call back down to give the clerk a piece of my mind when i heard my wife cry out. there on the wall of the bathroom were several roaches crawling around and i noticed something else in the sink that almost made us leave then and there. there, in the sink and in very plain sight, was a used condom! so far we were less than thrilled about being there and we stomred back downstairs and demanded our money back. by then the desk manager had returned from where ever she went off to and talked us into taking another room, free of charge to make up for our troubles. the room itself was thankfully clean with no bugs and no trash or any other disgusting items laying around. despite being a lot smaller and not having the promised view that our other room should have had, we decided to make due. so while my wife went to get cleaned up after our long trip i pulled my laptop out to use the so called high speed internet access. i shouldn't have even bothered as i've used dial up that went at least three times as fast as the speeds i was getting. with a quick call to the desk i was informed the person responsible for the internet was gone for the day and there was nothing that could be done for the moment. so instead of worrying about it, we went to get something to eat from the the onsite dinning area. yet again we were met with rude people who either stared at my wife's chest or forgot half of our order. after arguing with them for what seemed like forever over not getting everything, we found that our found was not only bland, it was cold! we didn't even bother trying anything else, that was the final straw so we got our things and found another hotel. i don't know who would hire a bunch or rude employees who was barely out of high school or who couldn't clean a room, but i know that that hotel didn't deserve four diamonds unless it was in the negative. that place should be shut down because there is no way they know how to run a decent hotel.
truthful	booked this on priceline for an insanely low price of $65 a night. the bf and i were amazed when we got there--the person checking us in was friendly and helpful to suggest some local nightspots and the room was gorgeous! a nice upscale, downtown feel and super comfy beds. we had a fabulous view from the 25th floor that inlcluded a sliver of lake michigan, a sliver of the taste of chicago crowds, and some friendly office workers in the builiding next door who waved to us a few times. seriously. we had a pretty anonymous experience the rest of our stay--which was fine with us. the hotel consists mainly of 2 towers and is like a huge, sprawling city inside. but we weren't there to stay in the hotel room the entire time...we like to get out and explore as much as possible. the location was fantastic. easy walking distance to michigan avenue and the rest of downtown. we walked for blocks well into the night and never felt like we needed a cab. i also highly recommend the urban cruise on the river (the entrance is right across from the hotel)--we saw some amazing architecture from the boat and got to cruise lake michigan a bit too. don't park your car here if you don't need to--it's very expensive. park downtown or ditch the rental car--you won't need it anyway, you can walk to tons of stuff or grab a cab. love chicago and totally recommend this hotel!
truthful	"i found this hotel in the ""small luxury hotels of the world"" booklet having stayed in many of these in recent years, and they were indeed above and beyond average hotels. i therefore chose it for a 4 night stay while visiting from england. the talbott was excellently located, although i had a view of a building site, and did have an ambience and some charm, however it was a little dirty and faded around the edges and the service was appalling. i had to wait in the foyer well after check in time, having previously attempted to check in earlier, tired and in need of a rest, while a ""final check"" was done to my room. the valet parking was not outside when requested, breakfast was not included in the price, all the things requested of reception did not occur, and there were very few touches which make a hotel stay special. i have stayed in hotels which are so much more elegant, where the staff and service are first rate for half the price of this hotel. i was severely disappointed and cannot recommend it at all."
truthful	arrived on 06/04/05, greeted by friendly doorman, and zipped up to the 5th floor lobby. very open lobby area with friendly reception staff. room was on the 12th floor and very nice. everything was in order and very clean! the king size bed was nice and each night i had a restful sleep. bathroom was large with separate glass shower stall. the room was furnished with everything i needed including internet hook-up access. also, you can walk thru on the 5th fl to the westfield north bridge shopping mall, where you will enjoy nordstrom and other stores. of course, you're steps from michigan ave. too. the central location of the hotel was great, as i could walk to most places. the cta subway stop (grand ave. on red line) was an easy 2 block walk. i will stay here again on my next trip to chicago!
truthful	we stayed at the intercontinental for three nights last weekend. it is a located in a fantastic spot on the magnificent mile, right near the chicago river and the nbc building. we had a double room in the main tower. the room was very clean and updated. the staff were very friendly and helpful. the negatives about this hotel is that you have to pay extra to use the fitness centre and internet access. also, parking is high ($45 valet/day). overall, we had a great stay and would recommend this hotel. we paid $90 on priceline and felt that this was a reasonable price.
truthful	this hotel was wonderful! i am a college student who went with my mom for the weekend and we both liked it! pros: the front desk and the staff!!! -helpful: knew great places to eat and how to get there breakfast: pastries, coffee, tea, muffins, etc: fresh drinks + hors d'oeuvres: yummy!! rooms -clean -well decorated lots of people of different ages stayed there cons: very very very far from the museums
truthful	"i haven't actually stayed at this hotel- yet- but am already disappointed in their customer service. i visit chicago quite often and usually stay at the intercontinental, but yesterday i read some online articles advertising the james hotel's ""cyber monday special"". the promo states that if you buy a gift certificate from their website, the hotel will match that amount in ""james credits"" that can be used toward your stay. none of the articles gave an expiration date for these credits. my next trip to chicago is in april, so i thought i'd give the james a try. i travel frequently with my pet and i've heard they have a very liberal pet-policy. so today i went online and bought a $500 certificate. me, having the one track mind that i do, somehow missed the part about the credits expiring march 31, 2010. i realized my mistake immediately and called the hotel front desk to explain my predicament. i said i couldn't be in chicago until april (i'm overseas on business until then), and asked if they could extend my credits an extra month, or it not, refund my gift certificate purchase. i had only just made the purchase minutes before and hadn't even recieved my email confirmation yet. most businesses offer a 24 hr grace period. the girl at the front dest was extremely rude to me- basically saying ""too bad, it's your problem now"". she didn't even bother to act polite or pretend to be sympathetic about my situation at all. so now that i know this is the kind of service i can expect from the james, i might just call it a wash and stay at my usual hotel, or try hotel monaco. i hear they have great service and are good with pets too."
deceptive	my stay at sheraton chicago hotel and towers was wonderful, i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good, i was able to get to my meeting well rested, thank you sheraton! -bobby
truthful	i booked this via priceline, and was not sure i'd like it, as some sheratons have fallen off the cliff. this hotel absolutely surpassed my expectations. despite booking with priceline, i was treated like a king. they let me check in early, gave me a beautiful room, and even went so far as to look up my starwood number so i could get some credit for the stay. the staff was unfailingly pleasant, the property immaculate, and the room very comfortable. i highly recommend this hotel.
truthful	what a wonderful experience, super great, helpful, friendly staff. angie at the front desk made sure my husbands birthday would be great. our room was beautiful. angie suggested we go to sullivans for dinner..perfect choice, make the reservation for us.(best seat in the house and a special dessert) wow...above and beyond what any other hotel or staff has done for us before..looking forward to staying there again & again. thanks again
deceptive	i have recently stayed at the hyatt regency chicago hotel and although i have stayed there a variety of times before, for both business and pleasure, my experience this time was particularly poor. from right when i checked in to the day i left i felt like i was constantly around unfriendly people who didn't want to be at work their to do their jobs. my room was dirty the whole time even though the maid came every day, and when i was trying to sleep at night it was so loud in the hallways, i couldn't sleep. for my next visit to chicago i won't be staying at the hyatt regency.
deceptive	this is the hotel for the discriminating business traveler. it offers spacious rooms that are elegant and refined. with a cozy area complete with chairs and fireplace, they are the perfect place to entertain clients or discuss strategy for a business meeting with a colleague. the restaurant offers just the location to impress a perspective client. and all of this elegance and refinement in the heart of downtown chicago
deceptive	the talbott hotel was very classy, professional, and luxurious. i loved how the staff was nice and respectful. i was treated like i was royalty when i was there, when in checked i was greeted by all of the people working behind the front desk and was offered a tour of the hotel. they took my bags and put them in my room while i was taking the tour and they even escorted me to my room right after we were done. this is a very nice and modern looking and their rooms are spacious and clean unlike other hotels in their area. i have recommended this hotel to all of my family and friends and would recommend it to anyone who is going to stay in that area.
truthful	we've stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service - the staff wasn't rude, just incompetent. for example, we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room, which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel. nonetheless, the staff brought us 4 coffee mugs... the list of issues goes on unfortunately, including the low grade in-room movie options - our audio and video did not sync on our rental; we eventually had to stop watching after 20 minutes. and the room itself was not clean; the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold. clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities, but training or sufficient staff... oh, but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same. find a newer hotel, there are many in this great city.
truthful	this was a wonderful stay. the staff was extremely helpful , the rooms are especially large, and the fact they have a small kitchen makes everything a lot more easy. the breakfast and supper were excellent. they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable - for instance, they have take-away plates you can take up to your room. the business center, gym and pool also make this my first choice next time in chicago.
truthful	this is a superb hotel. the rooms are huge, including a luxurious bathroom. it is clean and service is first rate. breakfast was excellent (and complimentary for hilton honors members). hotel is in a good location, and is connected to a mall, which i imagine would be a great asset in the chicago winter. next time i go to chicago, i will stay here for sure.
deceptive	the homewood suites by hilton, in downtown chicago, has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city. after asking the doorman, i discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen. the full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take, as did the stove and lcd televisions. this is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in chicago. it's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $40 a night, which is what i payed when i stayed there in september. the atmosphere was warm and cozy, and the staff were all very friendly and professional.
deceptive	i had reservations to check into the chicago conrad. when we arrived my wife and i were told the hotel was oversold and that i would have to take a double room rather than a king. this was a special weekend for my wife and i so this was a big disappointment. we were offered a free dinner which we accepted. the restaurant was dark and the food was fairly good. the tub in the bathroom was clogged with hair and we had to call maintenance to repair. this took about an hour to resolve. overall we would not pick this hotel again. they should make sure all commitments are met and rooms are in excellent condition. we feel it was not a good value.
truthful	we just got back from 3 nights at the sofitel. we really have nothing bad or negative to say about it. we've stayed at other higher end hotels in chicago such as the park hyatt, the peninsula, and the four seasons - and the sofitel tops them all. it's a 4 star hotel with 3 star prices. it's a beautiful hotel all the way around. staff is uniformly friendly without being patronizing. they were helpful with the one small problem we had and solved it quickly. the common areas are fresh and modern in appearance. the room was very clean with comfortable beds and well-appointed marble-accented baths. my wife loved the huge tub. we had breakfast via roomservice every morning and it was always hot and delicious. the robes and evian at turndown was always appreciated. the property is ideally situated in the middle of the gold coast and all the best shopping and eating is within a short walk. want a bentley or latte? they're all close by. this was our second stay since it opened and i'm sure it's to be our home away from home when we are in chicago.
deceptive	"having recently been in chicago for business and based on proximity and aesthetics, i decided to reserve a room at the conrad hotel in chicago and i couldn't have been more delighted with every aspect of my two-night stay. every conceivable amenity is available from the 42"" plasma flat-screen to both wired and wireless internet connections available i was able to stay in constant contact with the office all while in the enviable lap of luxury. my room was not only comfortable and clean, but warm and inviting just as if it were home away from home. if you're in the chicago area, reserve a room at the conrad hotels and resorts and you will not be disappointed."
truthful	i was expecting an experience comparable to my stays at the olympia in seattle. the decor and overall feel of the hotel was much above average but not inspiring. biggest disappointment was the inadequate internet connection in the room. the wireless was very slow and the hard-wire from the wall did not work at all. i did request a replacement of the wall wire, but it did no help. this hotel can do better than this. with a 5 star rating, it should be an experience to be pleasantly remembered -- but, was just a mediocre experience for me. even the bed covers were not that special. needs more intense management. next time, i will try the trump facility thanks
deceptive	i wouldn't know how to begin to write something negative about the millenium knickerbocker hotel in chicago. everything about this hotel is fantastic from the outside of the building to the hotel lobby all the way to the rooms. with very clean and plush rooms, this is the place to stay! when you are not at the hotel eating at the elegant dining area or having a great breakfast first thing in the morning, there is plenty to do around the town. take a shopping spree down michigan ave or head to one of the museums or the pier to look around. whatever you decide to do, you can't go wrong. this place is wonderful!
truthful	my daughter and i were in chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in illinois. we were only in chicago on our way home. we didn't know where to stay in chicago, but booked one night at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers based on their ad in the chicago visitors guide. we're glad we did! we enjoyed our stay very much. our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city. that's what we wanted--a great view, and we got it. also, the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop (we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it wasn't bad--saved us a lot of money). the elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available. we found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating. the only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in chicago. we wish we could have stayed there at the sheraton for at least another night. we would definitely stay there again.
truthful	"they allowed parties to go on all night and booked us in a room with no running water. we called security twice for them to do nothing about the party. when they finally came up about 30 people filed out of that room only to file right back in after about 10 minutes. when we called back nothing was done about it. my 2 year old son was awaken by all the loud music and cursing. then we get up the next morning at 7:30 to get ready only to find that we have no running water. after the maintenance man piddles around with it for a half hour we have no time to shower and have to ride the two hour train ride dirty and tired from no sleep. they did not resolve this issue. they just keep passing my complaint to ""managers"" supposedly. it was the worst stay of my life and my poor two year old had to be there for it"
deceptive	the palmer house hilton in chicago is by far the best experience i have ever had away from home. from the moment you walk into the elegantly appointed lobby, you will never want to leave. the multiple ballrooms, board rooms and private dining rooms make this the perfect site for weddings or business events. if you're looking for leisure activities, there are two bars, the lockwood wine cellar, and an indoor pool. the staff is professional, friendly and helpful. room service is excellent, and the hotel is conveniently placed to several major attractions in the city.
deceptive	i walked into this beautiful hotel and knew that i would have a wonderful stay in chicago. after walking around the city all day, i was always excited to relax in this cleanly and superbly comforting place. the service was friendly and i especially liked the location. what a treat!
deceptive	this hotel is in a great city with great personnel working there. the rooms are more than you can expect for a hotel. the services are abundant, leaving no room to complain. with their fine diners, you cannot go wrong with enjoying a peaceful meal while relaxing. with this hotel, it is truly an all-in-one hotel. there are meeting rooms and business centers, leaving unfinished work not be a worry during the stay. in addition, the spacious swimming pool is just the thing needed to relieve yourself of stress. the views from the rooms are breathtaking. i would definitely recommend staying there!
truthful	we connected to affinia chicago thorugh a city websight. the deal was fair for a downtown hotel on the main drag with an attractiion included. there was information out there that the hotel was being overhauled although we did not pay much attention to that. they are currently under major construction. they will be a little late of their projections in the finish date. i must say that the staff tried very hard to make our stay comfortable under very difficult circumstances. the room was complete and was good. it had a very nice bathroom. the main lobbie and all hotel amenities are totally unfinished drywall with no food, drink, or rest room opportunities. the construction guys did their best to limit activity and noise to after 9:00am. i think this will be a good one once they are done. as of the end of may, they have a way yet to go.
deceptive	"i recently visited chicago. i stayed at the hotel allegro chicago. first of all i did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel. my hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast. the food served was not up to par i felt like it was a cheap ""free"" lunch. my room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them. my toilet paper row was half way finished when i checked in. i felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room. i did not feel safe, i had to hide my valuables and i kept the ""busy"" sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff. the rooms did not appear as they do on their website, it is actually the opposite. looked to me like a regular motel inn but i paid way more than i would have at an actual motel inn. i did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
deceptive	when we stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago, we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced. our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby. and finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor. the room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day, it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side. our experience was definitely not a pleasant one. to make matters even worse, we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left. i am never coming back to millennium knickerbocker hotel.
truthful	my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro in march, 2006. we had a great time! we were upgraded to a suite, and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with mr. bubbles, animal print robes, and a luxurious king- sized bed! the suite was very nice, and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street. it was very boutiquey, and the lobby was lovely. we enjoyed the complementary wine hour. the staff was attentive, and our stay in this kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to chicago memorable! we would return here!
deceptive	i stayed here in the last weekend of september 2010 for the bears vs packers monday night game. my room rocked! i had a pretty big flat screen, and a super soft bed. the room was clean and stylish, and the staff was very courteous from check-in to check-out. my favorite part was the amazing bathroom - way better than mine at home. i definitely had a great escape that weekend and would recommend this hotel to anyone looking to relax.
deceptive	if there is ever a hotel you should stay at it is the sheraton chicago hotel and towers. this is the most beautiful hotel i have ever seen. this hotel has more than you will ever need or want. you can pick from a room that is decorated in great taste. there is a in room refreshment center,high speed internet, 32 inch television ,coffer maker with great coffee from starbucks. you could get a suite or the presidential suite with more room than you will ever need. the room is over 2000 square feet.it over looks the chicago river. there is plenty of activities with a great fitness center and a big indoor heated pool.the sauna was just wonderful. if you want to sight see in the area you can walk to the navy pier,or art institute. when you come back hungry you can eat at the elegant steakhouse which had some of the best food we ever ate. have a few drinks at the great bar, then create your own burger at the chicago burger company. the staff was very friendly and super helpful. the hotel was the cleanest i have ever seen. i will come again and again. a big thumbs up to this great hotel.
deceptive	though grand and having a brand, this hotel seems to disappoint me on certain fronts. 1. staff seemed snooty and arrogant. 2. request for upgrade was fulfilled only after repetitive requests.the initial room was very small. 3. for the cost paid i would expect a coffee maker, free internet service at the least which even regular b&bs offer. 4.they will levy charges on each and everything.complete rip off other things matched the grandeur.cleanliness and location was good, but the staff made my stay unpleasant.
deceptive	i needed to find a last minute hotel to stay in for the night so i came to this one. first of all the prices for one night are extremely high. the workers at the front desk were not kind at all and treated me like i was a second rate and not on their list of priorities. then i got into my room and got settled and it smelled of cigarettes and the air conditioner was making loud sounds so i didnt get much sleep. also the restroom was very dirty and frankly disgusting. the beds were very old and uncomfortable and the tv did not work at all. overall i am very disappointed with this hotel.
truthful	"we became an ambassador member just before spending mother's day at the chicago intercontinental, and received a room upgrade to an exceptional room. our saturday night stay was the best $99 we ever spent (mother's day special). the welcoming chocolate covered strawberries began the weekend on a high note; the concierge continued it by arranging a wonderful dinner (moderately priced) , and the great sunday breakfast topped it all off. all in all, mother's day in chicago was super. we loved it enough to be back for labor day weekend (another ""package"")."
deceptive	i booked my weekend chicago stay at the hard rock hotel in chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews i found online. however, my experience at the hard rock hotel fell short of my expectations. when i arrived, well over an hour of check in time, i was told that my room was not yet ready and i was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as i did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in. the hotel staff i interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs, and while i do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd, there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor i was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down (after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue). as i am a fairly light sleeper, i woke up several times throughout the night. i would recommend bringing earplugs if you're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep. overall the hotel looked very nice, but i just felt that my experience was not worth the amount i paid for my room.
deceptive	couldn't have asked for a better home base for checking out downtown chicago. hotel sofitel is right in the heart of the action, allowing my friends and i to hit the clubs and enjoy the local cuisine downtown's famous for. the room was comfy, with two queen mattresses, down stuffed duvets and chic decor. the bar downstairs was a bit pricey, but made up for it by being comfortable, sleek, and staffed with attentive bartenders who made excellent cocktails. one night we didn't feel like going out so we headed downstairs to eat at the cafe des architectes, which had an amazing array of choices, mostly of the french persuasion. i would definitely book here again!
truthful	this hotel was not worth it. from the moment we walked into the hotel lobby through check out, the staff were rude and contemptuous. rooms were only serviceable, and certainly did not live up to the pompous self-descriptions on the website. the bathroom porthole and sliding door were odd and inconvenient. the 'fitness centre' was tiny and poor. we would not come here again.
truthful	we just returned from our first trip to chicago and stayed at the omni. i read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on. the location, staff, rooms, amenities, etc were all wonderful. huge thank you to ta members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program. we did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks. i loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the chicago tribune newspaper. we were in room 816 which was perfect. corner suite with two out of the 3 sides of the rooms being windows with a great view. the room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma tv. the bathroom amenities were wonderful. i loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided. the turn down service was great as well. we would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us. we ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious. the blueberry muffins were the best i have ever had. everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly. the staff at the omni is so accomodating. everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is. have to thank the concierge melissa and curtis. they were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do. i also used the gym during my stay and it was great. all the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd tv attached. and the gym itself had two plasmas. they also had cold lemon water for you after your workout. i am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning. it really was a fantastic stay at the omni and we would never stay anywhere else. i also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there. everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed. thank you trip advisor for another great trip suggestion!
deceptive	i had high hopes for the hilton chicago, but i am sad to say that i am disapointed. not only is it outrageously expensive (over $200 for two people for one night), but they expect you to pay over $40 to park your car! they do not offer free wi-fi, but instead i had to pay $20 to get on the internet in my room. i had to wait until 3 pm to check in (even though my flight was in the morning) and i had to rent a car at the airport because the hotel did not offer transportation too and from. after all of this stress, the hilton chicago didn't have an in hotel bar either. i doubt i will stay here again!
truthful	my parents booked five nights at the james for its location and good reviews. they had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff. they sent engineers three times to repair the unit, and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it wasn't, under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty. at my parents' request, the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort. the hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room. don't book this hotel in the summer. and by the way, there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings.
truthful	the air-condition has a noisy fan/compressor in each room. it starts every 3 to 5 min and the noise will wake you up. at least the first night. this is an old fashion system that needs to be replaced. the postal service at the hotel is non-working. the hotel messed up our concert tickets that was correctly addressed and transported by ups. the tickets were at the hotel general managers office. the reception denied that they had arrived. we had to spend most of a day travelling to the ticket agent to resolve it. the hotel did not find any reason to apologize for the inconvenience. the concert was the reason for our travel to chicago. else, the hotel had good standard, free internet in the lobby, not to good view from the rooms, and friendly staff at the restaurants and the bars. we had booked 20 room-nights all together staying at room 612, 425 and 431 from the 23rd june.
truthful	in from minneapolis and was hoping to stay on michigan ave at hotel. when we arrived we were told a previous guest had extended their stay so we did not have a room. the hotel moved us to another hotel 2 miles away in a less than desireable location. management on duty was unfriendly and even stated they would call security if we did not leave. they gave us $15 for cab fare. will never stay there again. happened to numerous guests the same weekend.
truthful	i was looking for a fun, contemporary hotel and it didn't deliver. the lobby was nice, and the rooms were mostly clean, but it really wasn't special. service time was slow for room requests, i found empty water bottles under the chair, and the a
truthful	in the windy city ,this is a very good place.amazing rooms and service.everything is a walking distance .an absolute must for business trio as ease with which you can conduct and schedule meetings here is unbeatable. good decor and impishly modern
truthful	stayed here for 4 nights in apri. from check in the stay was perfect all round, staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially chris and scott. the location couldn't be better right on michigan avenue so easy access to everything. room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day. will definately recommend it to friends and family.
truthful	great beds, clean rooms, amazing bathroom, nifty view, wonderful service, expensive parking ($40, but it's chicago), speedy in and out. very european in sensibility and amenities, but with air conditioning!
truthful	first let me say, the front office people at hotel monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what i'd hoped. there are some other problems; the furnishings are quite rundown, and housekeeping wasn't very helpful. we booked a suite and the sofa bed, chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use. i've attached pictures, so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows. comfortable it was not! the chair bottom is all broken down too. i invited one of the assistant managers to view our furniture, and a slight adjustment was made in our rate. as to housekeeping, we had ordered an in-room coffee service (which kimpton's web site says is there, but you have to specifically request) and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee. we had to call the front desk every day. and, housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl. i had requested water be added to the bowl when i noticed it going down and my note was disregarded. these things may not matter to you, but if you plan to spend a week, like we did, you might want to be comfortable. the bedroom and bathroom were superior; just the living room was bad.
truthful	"so...the location to the clark/lake train stop is great...and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel. the wall are very thin...so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway. there is no coffee maker in the room, however; free coffee is available in the lobby...becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? finally, the ""business center"" is a pay for use set-up...no courtesty internet usage or printing. lastly...they bathroom is micro-tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort."
truthful	i booked a room at the hyatt through priceline and was able to get a rate of $45/night! can't go wrong with that! the rooms are nice, spacious, clean and contain all the amenties a traveler would need. i have to say that i have fallen in love with the hyatt chain due to their customer service. i have stayed at a few of their hotels in different cities and the staff has always been extremely friendly, which you don't often see at other hotels. i used the self-check in machine, and the customer service person checked in on me to make sure everything was going smoothly. then, when she saw that my room was not on a high level, she offered to have it changed for me so that i could have a better view. i would highly recommend this hotel!
deceptive	upon entering the hotel monaco chicago, i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building. the old fashioned furnishings, the wonderful view, and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel. at first i had been skeptical, but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone. as i entered my room, the fresh flowers and the amazing chicago view greeted me. during my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool, winding down every night with a comforting massage. i would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance, but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities.
truthful	i stayed in this hotel for 5 days in november together with my colleagues. internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day. no fridge or microwave included in the price. our room had two too soft full size beds. in the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall. who doesnt believe it, check out the 16th floor close to room 212. with discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous. i stayed in the hyatt regency before for much cheaper and that was way better. the restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty, but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served. please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby.
truthful	was slated for two nights in chicago, june 12 - 14, 2007. i could onyl get the intercon for both nights. i booked a handicapped room since that was they had left. after reading other reviews of the property, i decided to move it from two nights to one, and stay the second night at the hotel monaco. of course, upon check-in, i was given a suite. nice room, great linens, clean bathroom, and very quiet. parking is really high ($48). i understand some peopel saying the rooms need to be updated, but everything was clean and worked well. at ,ost, the rooms were a bit dark. i had a late night drink at the bar, which was reasonably priced. i did not eat there, but the menu seemed pretty good, albeit with the typical hotel mark-ups to be expected. in all, i thought the place was everything i needed, and was very happy with the room, the staff, the linens, and the housekeeping. much better than others have indicated.
truthful	beautiful place with european charm. no complaints, great location, (never like parking in chicago, though). it was $35 a night next door. large beautiful lobby, a touch of class. fantastic location for downtown, navy pier, and the great grant park(millenium park, too)...loved it.
deceptive	my family stayed at the hotel monaco hotel in chicago from 2-5 september 2011. i have no complaints about the rooms but i do have to complain about the staff in general. when we checked in the lady at the desk was rude to my children, take it they were a little loud but it was daytime and she should have never spoke directly to my kids that way. the cleaning crew the next morning didn't even knock at our door before opening the door. my children were still sleeping and i was in the shower. thank god my husband was already at his conference. the hotel was beautiful but the staff makes for a horrible experience. louisiana resident.
deceptive	"at first my husband and i were really excited for our family to enjoy the t-rex experience package. we figured it would be a great deal package even though the hotel itself felt too ""ritzy"" for us to travel with our four children. but after two nights of downtown chicago fun we realized that the talbott transcends it's ritzy look and truly embraces a family friendliness which we thoroughly enjoyed."
deceptive	the hyatt regency chicago hotel was a delight to stay at. i've never been to chicago before, but the location was fantastic. they had all sorts of different rooms, from non-smoking to smoking to hypo-allergenic rooms. i've never seen so many options for rooms. the room i stayed in was well worth the nightly price. the location was so close to all the activities my husband and i had planned for our vacation. we have never been treated so much like royalty than at the chicago hyatt regency.
deceptive	beautiful views and awesome service! my husband and i stayed at the swissotel in chicago while meeting up with some old friends from college. we have been to chicago a few times but never stayed at this hotel before. first off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing. so beautiful! the views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless. the fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference. from the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area, everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the chicago skyline. we took advantage of the executive club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the palm restaurant. delicious food! we will definitely stay at the swissotel the next time we visit chicago.
deceptive	my recent stay at the amalfi hotel in chicago couldn't have gone worse. apart from the price of staying there and the slow response time of hotel staff i was totally let down by the food that could be found there. there are many attractions in the area and indeed leaving the hotel is the best part of the experience.
truthful	we booked our hotel stay thru yahoo and requested a room for 4 with 2 beds. when we got to the hotel, not only did they not have a room for us (we pre-paid!), but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online, they could only give us what was available. the hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after i got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us. if you book online - beware! you may not get what you paid for. they did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room.
deceptive	the affinia hotel in chicago was superb. the room service was exemplary and the food, i don't even know were to start. the chef obviously knew what he was doing, i especially loved the seafood, my personal favorite was the shrimp. aside from this, i loved how beautiful the hotel was. it is definetly a bargain for the price, for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but, i felt as if i was in a $10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the europe. great bang for your buck. would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city. my friends actually went their a while back because of me. they loved it! i know you will too.
deceptive	"i had the misfortune of being booked at the amalfi hotel in chicago a few weeks ago. what a joke. to start off, the housekeeping staff must be on strike or they are very understaffed. i don't know who made the bed up in my room, but it could have been done better by my 7 year old. ditto the bathroom. water spots, soap scum and (ugh) hair of all kinds in the sink, tub and about the floor. gross. i requested non-smoking, either they didn't listen or didn't care, but my room and the linens smelled like an old ashtray. the ""beautiful view"" was ruined by water spots - not outside(which is forgiveable) but inside! and they were sticky. i stayed only one night. the holiday inn had rooms available, and they were clean. never again."
deceptive	"what i thought was going to be a romantic chicago weekend turn out to be lackluster. the swissotel chicago per their website seem to tout itself as a luxury destination well much to my surprise it was not. first my reservation was messed up instead of getting ""the classic room with a view"" we were put in what i guess is their classic king. the view was nothing to write home about. when i called the front desk to complain about the situation i was told their was nothing they could do since the hotel was booked solid. i asked how could this happen when i got a confirmation? the clerk simply said ""probably a glitch sorry is there anything else i can help you with?"" at the point i hung up the phone as i knew our romantic weekend with a view was not going to happen. when we checked out i told a manager what happened and he said there was nothing we can do sorry"" i expected a little more customer service from them since they think of themselves as a luxury destination."
truthful	stayed for 3 nights for our anniversary. the desk clerk was great and since it was our anniversary, he gave us an upgrade...imagine our surprise when we got off on a floor with only 3 other rooms! corner tower suite with a view of the river and michigan ave. beautiful! cabs available right outside the lobby... never paid more than $7 for a cab ride. if you go in dec. you must go to the chriskindl festival for strudel!
deceptive	"i had heard good things about the ambassador east and decided to stay there on vacation with my husband -- what a mistake! first off, they charge for being able to use the internet, which should be a given these days, especially for how much you pay for the room. the ""champagne"" was cheap , i could have spent $15 to get my own bottle. the king room was just as small as a double room anyway. the bed was really hard, and crudely made. maybe there was someone new on the staff that didn't know how to make a bed, but besides that, the sheets were starched to military stiffness. it was so uncomfortable! when i asked if we might get some new sheets, the staff were so incredibly rude and told me i was basically stuck with what i had because they're ""all that way"". i was appalled! anyway, we gave it a shot and stayed there that night, in the mediocre luster of the room design. we didn't sleep well and didn't particularly enjoy ourselves, especially because apparently there was a wedding going on in the building because we could hear the party! i mean, talk about the opposite of peaceful! again, we tried appealing to the staff to have our room moved away from the party, but they said they couldn't move us because of the romance package. what a jip! after the kind of ""fun"" we'd had, we realized we couldn't handle anymore. we called for a manager the next morning and fought with him for a couple hours. we wanted to just cancel the second night of our stay, and he said he'd do that, but that we'd still be charged a percentage of it! after telling him everything that had happened and how displeased we were, we finally got him to not charge us and left to go stay at another hotel that was actually relaxing."
truthful	i recently stayed at this hotel with my family (10-1 / 10-3). we had a terrific experience. i landed the hotel through priceline for $80 per night and paid an additional $75 per night for a suite on the 41st floor. my two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the 42nd floor was easily accessible. i found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating. i would love to stay here again.
truthful	"room: i stayed in the 16thz floor. 2 double bed room. the room has a decent size. equipment is state of the art. the furniture are stylish. room size was very nice. i could have left my big suitcase opened throughout the stay (which rarely happens in most hotels ;)) 42"" lcd screen complimentary wifi in the room the bed and pillows are of extrodinary quality which provided an excellent deep sleep to me. location located quite central. shopping streets are in reach of 5 minutes by feet. midway airport is in reach by cab within 30 minutes (~30 usd). service - spa and fitness exists - though i did not use. - restuarant (not used) - business center - very friendly and helpful staff. (even printed our boarding passes at the reception) i do travel frquently, and do recommend this hotel for a business stay, as also for an overnight with friends going shopping, partying whatever in the city center of chicago. pricing was very moderate for teh standard being provided at a downtown hotel."
deceptive	i was here on business so i needed to get some rest the next day but the walls were so thin that i could here all the carrying on in the neighbors room till 3 am. this was very beautiful building the room was a lot smaller than i expected and the staff were not very friendly. the person at the front desk had no personality, did not even welcome me to the hotel. all in all i don't think i will be back.
deceptive	if you are looking for a luxurious downtown chicago experience, the conrad chicago is the place to stay. the rooms are equipped with the most comfortable beds dressed with the most luxurious bedding, a 42 inch flat screen television, a spa like bathroom with marble vanity and soaking tub, and views of downtown chicago that will take your breath away. the hotel has many amenities for you to enjoy while you are there including great restaurants and bars, high speed internet, a fitness facility and laundry services. this hotel was a great place to stay and i would recommend it to anyone looking for a high quality place to stay in downtown chicago.
truthful	"mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems. first the good: outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland, as befitted the season. the restaurant service was absolutely flawless ( servers who don't write orders because they are expected to remember them, remember clients clearly from one day to the other, and go above and beyond consistently). rooms are comfortable: yes the beds are great! the gym is well equipped. second the slightly off putting: mmmhh...we got the ""i love chocolate package"" which advertized: bfast every day, dinner once, snack once and...a gift. and we have an a-club favorite guest membership, which also advertized "" a gift"". so, no gift...either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership. upon enquiry, ""the snack was the gift"". not at all what the package suggested. that said, bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well. some problems at checkout though: we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem. would absolutely go back, but probably not on a special package."
deceptive	my husband and i recently stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for our wedding anniversary - and what a pleasant stay we had! from the first moment we walked in, we were overwhelmed at the classy elegance of the lobby. i casually mentioned that it was our anniversary, and after we came back from dinner, we found champagne and strawberries awaiting us in the room. the staff was professional but friendly, and made us feel so welcome. the room was immaculate, the furnishings were so plush - we didn't really want to go home! room service was prompt, and the views were spectacular! we are definitely going to make this visit a yearly repeat.
deceptive	terrible experience, i will not stay here again. the walls were so thin that i was kept up all night by the party going on in the suite next to mine. i talked to the management several times, but nothing was done. it may just be the people that i had contact with, but i thought the staff was standoffish and rude. very unpleasant experience, especially given the cost of staying here!
truthful	staff was very courteous. desk clerk gave only one coupon for the free breakfast instead of two. second desk clerk gave the wrong time for the breakfast on the second day, causing us to miss the free period. room was very clean, with a nice view of the river. bed was very comfortable. toilet looked like it belonged in a public restroom (no tank; instead it had a stainless steel valve) instead of a 4-star hotel. no dresser to store clothes. no wastebasket in the room, and there was a cover for the icebucket, but no icebucket. folding luggage stand had a broken strap. location was good, close to the river. several american-style eating places nearby. overall, a disappointment for a four-star hotel. i expected more for a hyatt regency.
deceptive	the rooms were beautiful! the staff was friendly and helpful. i love where the conrad in chicago was located, it seemed to be close to a lot of places i wanted to visit. chicago was great, and the conrad hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional!
deceptive	i recently had the opportunity to stay at the conrad chicago hotel, located on north rush street. as part of the hilton hotel chain, i was confident that i would have a positive experience. unfortunately, from the time i walked in the door until the time i checked out, i was plagued with nothing but problems. when i walked into the hotel, i was not greeted by the concierge, which is usually a bad sign. (he was reading a newspaper.) then, when i announced that i was holding a reservation, they desk clerk was unable to find it. i had a confirmation number which they agreed matched a number in their system, but they could not find the room i had reserved. finally, they assigned me a room, but it was smaller than i had originally requested and it had a bad odor. i was very disappointed with the room and its decor. the room smelled of stale smoke, even though it was on a non-smoking floor. the bedspread was threadbare and there was no soap in the bathroom. i had to keep checking to make sure i was really at the conrad chicago. surely, this was not the way the hilton chain operates! there continued to be problem throughout my stay. i asked for a wake-up call and it was 15 minutes late, which had me scurrying around so i could make my business meeting. i ordered breakfast to be brought to my room, and it never showed up -- at all! and the water for my shower never reached anything by lukewarm, so my shower was short and unsatisfying. i decided to check out of the conrad chicago a day earlier than originally planned because i was so dissatisfied with the hotel and the way it attempted to resolve the problems and issues. upon my return home, i wrote a letter to the hotel manager, but never received a reply. because they refused to acknowledge that i had problems, i will not be staying at the conrad chicago again, and will avoid all hilton hotels in the future.
truthful	the lines at the check in desk were tremendously long so we decided to use the computerized self check in. the only option the self check in gave us was the size of the bed. when we got to our room, we immediately realized we were placed in a smoking room but we were unable or perhaps the staff was unwilling to move us to a non smoking room. i am allergic to the smoke and that made my stay uncomfortable. the walls seemed thin and we could clearly hear the conversations of the guests in the rooms next to us. when we went to breakfast, we were seated quickly but it was nearly ten minutes before our server arrived. for the price they were charging, the wait was unacceptable and we went elsewhere. it also took ten extra minutes than promised for the valet to get our car. for forty dollars a day for parking, we expected better.
deceptive	"i really had high hopes for homewood suites when i stayed there on a week-long business trip last month. after all, considering their prices (it's technically a hilton), you would expect something above and beyond a typical cut-rate bargain motel. i'll start with the good stuff about the hotel: it's in downtown. now for the bad stuff: first, everyone is rude. i'm not sure if management intentionally hires rude people or if the poisonous culture inside the hotel grinds otherwise decent people into cynical pulp. the bellboy scowled at me in the lobby, was rough with my luggage, and then scowled at me again when i tipped him $5. likewise, the receptionist seemed flustered and in over her head. she had to call her supervisor over *twice* just to check me in, and i had a reservation! apparently she was new, and didn't have much experience using the computer, but that's no excuse: it turned what would have been a two-minute process at a decent hotel into 15 minutes of tedium. sadly, the room was no better than the service. the hot water in the sink did not work, the shower was only lukewarm, and one of the bulbs was dead in the light fixture above the sink. complimentary mood lighting, i guess. the tv was a bust; sure it was an lcd, but the espn logo at the bottom right corner of the screen was burned in and stayed there on every channel. and to top it all off, the bed smelled funny. i called the front desk (at least the phone worked), and asked for fresh sheets. the person i talked to said they'd be right up, but never came. eventually, i gave up. i woke up the next morning to back pain (the bed was about as firm as a marshmallow). i left the room, and made my way through the chilly hallways to the ""complimentary buffet."" literally all the food was bad. even the cereal tasted stale. looking around, everyone in the dinning room appeared to be having a similar experience. the sight of two-dozen disappointed people sipping weak coffee and prodding watered-down scrambled eggs with plastic forks was a sight more becoming of a refugee camp than an expensive hotel. just plain sad. worst part was, it was the same thing for the next four days, too."
truthful	great hotel in heart of chicago for business or pleasure. rooms are recently upgraded and very modern and large. flat screen tvs, marble baths, all rooms are suites, great desk, kitchenette, comfortable bed, free wireless internet... everything you could ask for. location is easy walk to magnificient mile and lots of great restaurants. staff is friendly and helpful. short cab ride to loop.
deceptive	i would not stay at this hotel again. the rooms had a fowl odor. it seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned. the neighborhood was also less than desirable. the housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms. i will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted.
truthful	just putting in a good word for the hard rock hotel in chicago. the reviews i read before going were mixed so we were not sure what to expect. the location was perfect. the hotel was beautiful. our view was awesome. the room was large enough and very clean. the bed was very comfy. the staff were helpful - especially the concierge, jared. i couldn't find anything negative to say. if you want to stay in downtown chicago - you can't go wrong with this cool hotel.
truthful	i actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price! it was a lovely hotel, beautifully appointed, walking distance from the places we wanted to go. we would highly recommend the fairmont.
deceptive	my experience at the hyatt regency chicago was simply amazing. i had a wonderful stay there will my husband. my husband has allergy problems nearly everywhere we go, and we were worried about that so we talked to the desk clerk there. they were able to provide us with a hyatt allergy-friendly room. we were so relieved and the room was beautiful. the furniture in the room was actually cleaned with pure tea tree oil. it was the most comfortable stay we have ever had. on top of that my husband had to spend some time in the room working on some business, so the high speed internet they provided was very convenient. we took full advantage of the 24 hour room service. i will definitely stay there again. it is a vacation simply staying in your hotel room.
deceptive	i had originally chosen the conrad chicago hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance. however, i later learned that i had made a poor choice. upon arrival, the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk. although, when we reached out hotel room, we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite. my family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds. the clerk, after a twenty minute waiting period, was able to find us a suitable room. upon entering, the room was noticably hot. we turned on the air conditioning, and after waiting for thirty minutes, the room remained muggy and humid. i called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room. they promised a repairman within ten minutes. 1 hour later i called again and remined them that the repairman hadn't shown up. they once again promised a speedy repair. while waiting, i discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp. i called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level, but i had to go get them. after all this trouble, i argued that they should bring it up to me, but in the end, i wound up going to get it myself. after returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes, the repair man had not shown up. so i called again, and within 5 minutes the repairman came. he managed to fix the air conditioner, but it was about 12am. we were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off, but as the night went on, we noticed another problem. the air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds. it also emitted a strange odor. upon checking with the front desk, we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired. there were not available rooms left, and being so fed up with this hotel's poor service, we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel. i don't recommend the conrad chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time.
deceptive	the ambassador hotel is located in downtown chicago right off lakeshore drive in the heart of the hotel industry downtown. i would recommend you look to one of those other hotels if you are wanting a place to stay downtown. the rates at this hotel indicate that it would be a top of the line place to stay, when in fact, we had a pretty unpleasant experience. it started with someone who was obviously a new employee checking us in. i have no problem with this, except the fact that this person was the only one on duty and had difficulties checking us in and had no one to assist him. after checking in, we went up to our room and were a bit disappointed. the pictures do not accurately depict the size of these rooms, they are very tiny and offer very little room to store luggage where it is out of the way. the beds were not very comfortable and when we called room service for extra pillows, they took over an hour to arrive. i will not be staying at this hotel anytime in the future.
truthful	striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life. the attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night's sleep i've ever experienced in a hotel. gorgeous lcd tv and bose wave machine added to my enjoyment. sofitel is worth the extra $'s.
deceptive	my stay at the palmer house hilton was wonderful. i was attracted to this hotel because it was going to be me and my finance's first time in chicago. the location of the hotel was perfectly placed downtown chicago we took advantage of the hilton bed and breakfast special. upon check in on friday afternoon we went to the lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend. we stayed in a one bedroom suite with a king size bed. the hotel was spotless. i have never been in a hotel room that was so clean. the portions of food was perfect, and everything they provided was on point. i would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit chicago for the first time. the staff is professional, and let you feel like a king and queen.
truthful	very disapointed in the service and quality of this hotel. i travel quite frequently to chicago and have never had this happen at any other 4 star hotel. i reserved a king bed. at checkin i was informed they were out of kings and basically offered no type of compensation or upgrade. when i arrived at the room the air conditioner door was open and rattled all night. the tv did not work. had to call for service. the following day returned from work at 6pm and found the room had not even been serviced. stay somewhere else.
deceptive	the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is not the hotel for persons wishing to have a relaxing getaway. upon entering this hotel you have the impressions that it is a warm and inviting place. one encounter with the staff will change this point of view immediately. the person who assisted us was not very knowledgeable with his duties and did not provide the overall attention required or expected. everything about this hotel exudes class and sophistication. training for the staff should be conducted immediately in order to match classy look of the hotel with their interactions with the customers. i am truly diappointed with the fact that my stay at this hotel was as substandarded as it was. i was so looking forward to a wonderful stay at your establishment. i hope that the issues mentioned earlier are resolved. however, i do not plan to return to this hotel again.
truthful	"stay away! after generations as an old-world, cozy and stately, if a bit tired oasis, the ae has been purchased by ian schrager and taken down so many notches it's almost not functional. allowing for the fact that the hotel is under renovation, the entrance is not handicapped accessible, and i saw several hotel guests with canes, casts, etc (including myself, recovering from foot surgery and in a cast, with a cane) struggling with the up and down outside stairs one has to navigate just to get into and out of the hotel. with luggage, it's almost impossible. this is simply inexcusable. i've been a customer of the ambassador east for decades--but no more. the hallways are so dark one can barely see. the rooms are stark white, which in and of itself, isn't a particular problem, but it is jarring and almost painful as one's eyes adjust from the dark hallways. the furniture--stark and scant--looks like something from an ikea closeout. the bed is comfortable--what a relief--but only about 15 inches off of the floor, a real problem if you're at all physically challenged, or even elderly and less flexible than you were in your salad days. the problems don't end there. my room had a horribly uncomfortable wire/metal desk chair, and absolutely nowhere else to sit. no arm chair, no demi-sofa, no ottoman. with a foot in a cast, it would have been nice to be able to sit comfortably, perhaps even with my leg elevated, while in the room. no way. the bathroom has absolutely nowhere to put any of your toiletries. not a shelf, a small table, a nook, or a medicine cabinet. if you want to put a razor, shaving cream, makeup (for women) or anything else down so that you can use them, you're sh*t out of luck. repeated requests for a small table or some sort of chair went unmet. a borrowed umbrella from the front desk was broken and unusable, something i didn't discover until caught in an expected downpour. i was tempted to throw it out, but remembered that they would charge me for it if i didn't return it, in spite of its total lack of usefulness. refrigerator--forget it. shampoo? for two days in a row, the housekeeper left several bottles of lotion, and no shampoo. room service--not available. if you want breakfast, the front desk will sell you a small, pre-wrapped, commercial grade muffin for $4.00--something you can buy in any gas station for $1.00. no added value whatsoever. the photos show a nice entrance, and a large lobby for which the ae has long been famous. unfortunately, that lobby is closed off, under construction, and the temporary lobby is on the second floor, difficult, again, for handicapped access. thermos-bottled coffee and water for tea were stone cold, at 8 in the morning. when confronted with these various misses, the front desk staff repeatedly shrugged their shoulders and said, ""yeah, we know, you're not the first to tell us this stuff."" all this shows is that schrager doesn't even care to make an effort to make his guests comfortable, and that the staff is either too indifferent or too amateur to know the difference and even make an effort to get it right. it's one thing to get a good price on a hotel room when it's under renovation. it's another thing altogether to get screwed in the bargain, particularly after booking a non-refundable pre-paid reservation. again, avoid this hotel like the plague."
deceptive	the magnificent mile in chicago is a great place to visit, and staying at the affinia chicago just made it that much better! the location is awesome - all of the great shopping spots were just moments away, and getting to navy pier was a cinch! and the accommodations themselves were wonderful! the hotel lets you completely customize your stay, all the way down to choosing your own pillow! very impressed overall!
deceptive	my husband and i recently chose the palmer house hilton for a rare couple's getaway from our usual life, and an escape it truly provided. there is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time, let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user! a bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us, because things like alarm clocks, hairdryers and ironing boards were already there, electronic media even available for rent. with a comfortable bed, control over how the room felt, no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call, we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the chicago culture in close proximity. too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning, but the hilton was a true vacation. thank you.
deceptive	i really enjoyed staying at this hotel. the separated living room and bedroom made it feel like i was renting a nice furnished apartment instead of a hotel room. the kitchen was a comfort since i could prepare a meal for myself if i wished, and the refrigerator and microwave was a must since i never finish my meals when i go out to eat. i felt more at ease here rather than the detatched feeling i have with most hotels. i would recommend staying at this hotel if you want to feel comfortable and welcome in a sophisticated atmosphere.
truthful	"the talbott hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges. no - not a bit worn - very much so i'm sorry to say. although the location a block and a half from the best part of michigan ave. can't be beat, and the level of service is on par with many four seasons, there were quite a few bumps in the road. number one, the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing. the desk chair was so badly worn that the ""lift"" button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we're not grossly obese. the back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable. my husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth, one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk. the bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink, so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door. the towels were very well worn and thin, although bath sized, which was a plus. the restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say, it was horrific. we had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables, and they (appetizers) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen. a room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side, served on a large white plate, and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic american cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad. even the menu, as limited as it was, looked as though someone's child had written it out. the good news is that chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go. unfortunately for us, the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $325/nt for our disappointments. the good news is that the mini bars' wares were incredibly well-priced - when's the last time you had a $4 beer anywhere in a hotel? (even if it was bud and bud lite - lol!~) the front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating. the water out of the shower was hot and plentiful, and the bed comfortable. the a/c was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever, and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90's our entire stay. free wi-fi - yes! and it wasn't horribly grindingly slow! no need for the advertised ""upgrade"" for faster wi-fi. talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game. apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased, but we were sadly not."
deceptive	the service was only subpar and then rooms needed better cleaning. i was at the check in counter longer than expected because they decided to use a trainee to check me in, definitely no fun after such a long flight. there were no clean towels in the room and my bill was returned with room service charges of which i did not order.
deceptive	my recent stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park was everything i desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in chicago. i loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and ipod docking station. i appreciated the walking distance to all of chicago's premiere shopping areas. the concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations, while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service. the services i received at at myspa were some of the best in the world. dinner at aria restaurant was delicious. in short, fairmont chicago millennium park was the perfect luxury vacation, meeting all my needs and more!
deceptive	my husband and i recently traveled to chicago on a mini vacation. we stayed at the omni chicago hotel in the downtown area. this hotel is simply beautiful. from the time we walked through the front doors until the day we left, we were treated as if we were royalty. i have never been treated so well. we were greeted by staff that sincerely seemed to love their jobs. we stayed in a superior corner suite. the view of the city was the most amazing thing i had ever seen. the rooms were very spacious and clean. the king size bed was extremely comfortable. the room didn't seem like we were in a hotel, it had the feeling of home. there was a separate living room area which was wonderful, my husband and i just sat there one night and stared out the window at the skyline. it was mesmerizing. we ordered room service because we had a long day of shopping, which the hotel is very convenient to a lot of great shopping. most everything is in walking distance. the food was to die for; it was as if we were eating at a 5 star fine dining restaurant. we did manage to go down and have a few drinks in the lounge. the lounge had a classy feel to it, very relaxing yet sophisticated. we even received a massage, in our room. while we did have all the conveniences of home, such as internet and tv, we did not even think about using them, being that we just wanted to get away from our everyday lives. this was the most romantic vacation my husband and i have ever taken. i cannot express how happy we were to have stayed in this hotel. we had other options but i am so glad we decided to stay here. the rate for the room was so inexpensive for the amount of luxury we were able to experience, which the experience itself is priceless. i will definitely share my experience with anyone and everyone and recommend this hotel.
truthful	we stayed at the omni between christmas and new year's in 2008 just to get away for a few days. we found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap. so this year we checked online just a day or so after christmas and the deal was there again. it also included parking at the great price. huge suite overlooking downtown chicago. best location to walk everywhere. my 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows. can't wait to go back.
truthful	"this hotel cannot be beat for location, price, & atmosphere. the location is ideal, at the corner of state & kinzie. there are fantastic restaurants & bars all around, including house of blues & harry caray's. we stayed in a ""corner king"" room. the room was amazing. two of the four walls are floor to ceiling windows. even just being on the 5th floor, we had great views of the surrounding area. the decor and amenities are unmatched. the decor is very clean & simple but luxurious. the hotel is easy to miss from street level, but shouldn't be. the staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. its a perfect home base if your plans revolve around river north, state street shopping, or clark street nightlife. even if you'll be on the mag mile, this is a short cab ride away. we've officially named this our downtown hotel of choice!"
truthful	we were encouraged to stay at the affinia as part of a group in town for a chicago wedding. we booked our rooms 6 months in advance, with the promise of a brand-new, full service hotel in a great locaiton in chicago. the lobby was non-existant (under construction). the front desk staff was incredibly rude and unhelpful. the hallways and elevators are small, cramped and uncomfortable. the rooms are great - great beds, great television set. no room service - the kitchen is under construction. the bottom line is that during our stay, this was not a full-service hotel and should not have charged what they did. we were totally disappointed, hope it will improve, but vow to never stay there and will recommend to anyone to check out one of chicago's truly amazing hotels. it is not worth the risk with this unproven dress rehearsal.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers and there is no way i'll be going back. check in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk. my room itself was barely passable - the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before i ever was here. for the price i was paying, you'd think they'd allow access to the work out facilities, but they wanted an outrageous per day charge! top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you won't want to be spending any time here at all. to top it off, the promised discount rate wasn't honored at the end of my stay, despite being assured that all was well at check in! i ended up arguing with the manager about it when i was checking out - since i had to catch a flight, no resolution happened and as of yet, i'm still waiting for responses to my calls and letters. chicago has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night i paid, it wasn't worth it. even the shula's wasn't enough to make me want to return here.
truthful	"months prior to my 5-night reservation with the hilton chicago i requested a room that allowed in a lot of natural light, facing an open view, not a close building. (the reservation was made through a conference travel agency.) i confirmed my request by telephone a few days in advance directly with the hotel and at check-in the clerk noted it in my record. she told me it would be difficult to find, but consulted a chart and appeared to be satisfied with the room she assigned me. i was very surprised to open the door onto a room on the inside of one of the towers, tucked into a very dark corner, facing a wall of rooms. i called the desk immediately and was told that the hotel was sold out and it was hard to tell what rooms were still available that suited my request, but to ""sit tight"" and someone would call me. no one did. further calls yielded similar results. at one point i was told i could have a ""parlor room,"" with a sofa bed, at a reduced rate, but i could not go see the room before committing to moving. that's real hospitality for you. worried that a bad sofa bed could be worse than rooming in a cave, i ended up staying in the dreadfully dark room. (i had asked for a bright room with one bed and got a dark room with two beds.) the only redeeming feature of the room was that it had 2 bathrooms. other than that, it was tight quarters with a tiny closet, two uncomfortably low chairs, at the desk and in a (dark) corner. light fixtures didn't do much to brighten things up. since i was here at a conference, i really wanted a bright environment to wake up early and start the workday in and to have as a cheerful office for mid-day calls and e-mail, but instead i got a cave. consequently, i spent as little time as possible in the room and next time i am in chicago, conference or not, i will absolutely stay at another hotel. there are much better locations that the hilton chicago and looking at the percentage of ""inside tower"" rooms, places with a much better chance of having a bright room as well as better customer service. shame on the chicago hilton."
truthful	complete disappointment. problems: 1. the alarm clock/stereo thing was broken in my room. it was constantly emitting low, changing hissing noises. sooo annoying. and there was no off switch on the damn thing. i had to move the bed to unplug it (the outlet was wayyy back, buried behind the big bed). i kept hearing it, and didn't realize what it was, until it had kept me awake for a few hours. 2. the shower was only incredibly hot. turn it all the way cold...very hot. turn it to hot, and you get boiling hot. grrrrreat. so how do i get water that won't scald me? this is very inconvenient early in the morning when you need a shower and are in a hurry, and have to dance into and out of painfully hot water. good job omni! 3. hallway carpets are disgusting and old. walking around, you'd think you're in a motel 6. and my floor had been flooded or something, and they had box fans running in the hallway, 24/7, to try to dry it out. talk about an overpriced dump.
truthful	"while it was a nice hotel, but i am rather frustrated with them! during our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping. the first day was fine. second day my diamond earrings came up missing. noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process. my biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further. but we had a family reunion and funeral to get to. while the front desk was great and said they would handle it, i believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way! we filed a police report and the gm of the hotel is supposed to be working on it. we have called several times but receive no answers. they keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there 10 + years.....that dosen't matter to me! if they are not held accountable what's to stop them from taking anything. there is a dishwasher in the room, and they found my daughters ring (which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings) in the dishwasher. they say i put the cup in the dishwasher. first, i am on vacation, trust me i'm not doing dishes! second, why would i wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room? so, while it is a nice hotel....lock up your things of value! they may come up ""missing"" and you'll be left frustrated!!"
truthful	i love the free breakfast and dinners on weeknights. the hotel is clean and nice rooms the pool needs some updating(but kids don't care) my friend and i took our granddaughters for a grandma grandaughter outing and this hotel was perfect
truthful	we traveled to chicago to visit with our daughter who lives in the city. to our suprise what once was a lovely older hotel is now under major renovations. gone is the lobby and gusts are required to walk down to the basement to get the one... elevator that is working to the second floor to register. our first room was recently renovated.....stark white walls, no amenities at all. guests had to enter the room and find their way to the bed to turn on the light to the room. modern furniture includes a bed that is close to the groud, a cold blck slab functioning a a desh and metal chair. no fride, coffee maker, iron, or even a picture on the stark white walls. we asked to change our room and then were put in one of the older suites on the 15th floor. while this room was attractive, we were greeted to jack hammers at 8 every morning. the staff were all very nice but the accommodations were lacking. lake shore drive
deceptive	the hyatt regency chicago hotel is perfecty located in the center of downtown chicago. whether you are going there for business or pleasure, it is in the perfect place. the rooms are large and beautiful and the ball room took my breath away. the wi-fi connection was perfect for the work i needed to do and the show at the navy pier was perfect for when i needed a break. other hotels have nothing on the hyatt. i just wish there was a hyatt regency in every city for all of my business trips.
truthful	my wife and i stayed at this hotel at the end of may, 2009. she came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city. we got a deal on this hotel through travelzoos. $249/night stay for $99/night plus we got the full buffet breakfast. the room was wonderful. extremely large king size bed with expansive sitting area. we are used to smaller hotels with little room to move. the bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows. no wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit (poor taps). we could have upgraded to river view for $20/night but chose not to. we enjoyed the room for what it was. 22nd floor looking south. the buffet breakfast was great. lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs, non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please. great to have breakfast included in night stay. might be a bit dear to pay at $22/person. it was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast, coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal. concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat, always informative and ready to provide maps, directions, multiple suggestions and even make the reservations. cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs. location was great. blocks from el and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river. if in chicago again, would not hesitate to stay here again. a swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it.
truthful	the location of the hotel is great, right on the river and michigan ave. almost everything is within walking distance. at the price, though, and given the 4 star hotel, we expected better walls. our room was connected to other rooms on both sides by locked doors. the sound from both rooms came in loud and clear. we heard our one neighbor making business deals on his phone (he clearly wasn't speaking loudly), and the other neighbors up at midnight yelling and screaming when they came back drunk. we asked them to be quiet (i shouldn't have expected that to work with some young drunks) then called security, but they did nothing. i was completely annoyed with the noise, especially in an expensive business hotel such as this one. unless you are in chicago to party, get drunk, and not get any sleep, i wouldn't stay here.
truthful	this place had character i'll give it that. but it wasn't really my style. arrived late in the evening. the first room they gave me the tv didn't work. maintenance took a look at it, and couldn't figure it out. told me i'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. he then passed some gas and left. real professional. i phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room the second room was much like the first. horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. bathroom was incredibly small. hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. very cramped. the beds weren't very comfortable either. room temp hard to regulate and the ac somewhat noisy. location seem very convenient. i was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. but all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. and don't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card. it was about $2/minute. i knew it would be expensive but wasn't expecting that type of rate.
deceptive	hotel allegro chicago is a beautiful place. i was originally dreading being in chicago due to the fact it was all business and no play, but as soon as i saw the inside of the hotel i was stunned! i wasn't expecting to stay at a place that made business trip feel like a get-away vacation. the service there was amazing, everybody was very friendly. when i saw my room, once again my jaw almost dropped. the room was fit for a king, the designs on the wall were so elegant. the beds were extraordinarily comfy. i think for my next business trip i am going to bring my wife and kids with me. i give this kimpton hotel 5/5 stars!
truthful	we stayed at the palmer house hilton in early december, we stay there that weekend every december and we think it is the best location in the city for us. we like state street better than michigan avenue and the palmer house is right there. we stayed in the towers, in a room with two double beds and 2 baths. the room was not huge, but very comfortable. the towers area was recently refurbished and it shows, the lobby is beautiful with plasma screen tvs on the walls, comfortable chairs and tables and a seperate room for the food/drinks. there is a continental breakfast in the morning, appetizers during cocktail hour and cookies are laid out until the room closes. there is a fridge stocked with soft drinks, water and juice that are yours for the taking. we were very pleased with the upgraded towers, everyone should check it out!
deceptive	the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is one of the worse hotels i have stayed in. everything from the lobby to the staff to the room experience was horrible. as i walked in to the lobby, the lobby had a fowl smell, similar to rotten eggs. the staff wasn't much better, especially room service, where it took over 30 minutes just to make my request for more towels. the baggage handlers gave me rude service and when checking in or out, they almost just refuse to provide service. the room i stayed in was ill maintained and looked like nothing like in the pictures. the windows were dirty and i couldn't see anything outside the window. the room smelled like someone soiled the room and there were ants crawling on the tabletops. if i had to give any suggestion on this hotel, you should just avoid this hotel all together. even a cheap motel has better standards than this hotel.
deceptive	"my husband and i stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago this past summer. needless to say we will not be returning! the hotel is very overpriced for what you get. upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had. the bed was very uncomfortable and the ""fully-stocked honor bar"" was stocked with only a few choices. the shower did not even work!we booked the king suite with jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi. i would not recommend this place!"
truthful	we stayed here because of all the great reviews, and it's all true. we were highly impressed with the high quality of everything, everyone, and the location. walking distance to much of what chicago has to offer. gibson's steakhouse and the hancock building to name a couple. this hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for chicago. it should also have more than three stars. i mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard, and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those. depending on the room you get, any price under $250 would be a good deal. between 250 - 300 could still be worth it.
deceptive	this hotel is beautiful, it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it. the location is wonderful,it is close to magnificent mile and the navy pier, which was a great place to show the children on our vacation. we had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car,and the valet was very nice and helpful. i also take my work with me everywhere i go,so the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus. they have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing. this place is great for the price, due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is. this is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay.
truthful	this was a weekend trip for my friends and i. we booked a couple of rooms and asked in advanced for the reservations to be connected in some way. our rooms were right next to one another as requested. as it was almost everyone's first time to chicago, we had to do a bit of cold-searching for a hotel. and, our choice was next to perfect. i had an amazing time during my first visit to chicago and it was largely due to this hotel. the customer service was amazing. everyone was extremely nice and helpful. one of our rooms ordered late night room service and raved about how they felt they had ordered a 5 star lunch because it was as fresh as having ordered food at 2 pm, and delicious. my friend suggested they had a full-staff at 3 am because the food came up quickly too. in another of our rooms, housekeeping had accidentally discarded a cd when replacing the cd player with an ipod dock. the concierge had the exact cd purchased and ready at check-out from the neighboring record store. our rate included complimentary breakfast which was fantastic! everything was freshly made in their kitchen too. an added bonus was that the hotel is attached to a mall. therefore, you don't need to leave the building to get a pair of shoes, a coffee, or a some other type of trinket. i was beyond pleased with this hotel and would stay here again without hesitation.
truthful	attended a wedding in chicago; sofitel is new, humming, very very modern (w hotel style - minimalist) and a great location. however, i miss the basics of a less trendy hotel. we checked in at 7 pm and our room wasn't ready - when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me!!! i had to wait in the hallway .... on the weekend i came back for a nap at about 3:30 pm after vacating the room at 8:30 am and it still wasn't made up. the housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room. also called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me one....i gave up...this is a hot, youth hotel but for my next visit, i think i'd prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping, a somewhat larger room that you can walk around, and a less trendy, hot, loud clientele. i'm over 40.
deceptive	sofitel chicago water tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the magnificent mile, navy peir, the museum of contemperary art, lake michigan and upscale boutiques. this hotel is great for tourest. it has 450 great rooms and 33 high end sweets. it has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy. it has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws, while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar. overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in.
deceptive	"hyatt regency chicago seemed like a nice place to stay, but we didn't like it very much. the renovations were cheap and poorly done (our bathroom faucet was leaky and the carpet had bumps in it.) the staff was rude! i was trying to find a good cab service, and the guy behind the front desk made me wait for 20 minutes while he was finishing a phone call! couldn't he have at least called someone else to help me? the ""babies travel lite"" gave us the wrong sized diapers, so we had to go find some anyway, and with the hotel being located in the heart of the city that meant we found some unsavory characters along the way."
truthful	nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways, fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the omni. location was great but there are a lot of other options. if you get a really good deal on the room, i wouldn't say no.
deceptive	this hotel is ok but is not the best for the money. first of all the parking prices are exorbitant. i know parking is at a premium for this location but the price is much too high. also, the service at this hotel was poor. i felt like room service took too long and considering the price the service was poor in general, and the staff at the palmer house seemed more interested in helping the richer or more known customers more than us. in addition i feel that there were too many fees including a fee for internet. also the rooms were very clean and beds very nice but there was some noise and you could hear the people walking above you. i would say it was an average experience at this hotel and considering the price maybe think twice about the palmer house.
deceptive	my wife and i stayed here last weekend. it was our honeymoon and it was wonderful. this hotel was so beautiful inside and out. we were more than pleased with our room and the resturant was amazing. all of the staff here were very nice and polite. they helped us with any of our needs. i wish i could live in this place. all together it was one of the best weekends of our lives. we plan on coming back again. great hotel!
truthful	our trip was our annual anniversary trip. the hotel did not honor my choice of king size bed. instead we received two double beds. this seriously decreased our enjoyment of our stay at the hyatt. there were two cups of coffee complimentary in the room. no complimentary coffee anyplace else in the very large hotel. location was more of a business district, not appropriate for pleasure trip. employees of hyatt were very friendly and helpful, other than the failure to deliver the reserved room.
truthful	the lobby of the homewood is right down the hall from the kitchen and dining room(actually more of a grade school cafeteria type set up). the odors from the kitchen were disgusting, and indeed reminded my of that of a institutional kitchen(i.e. hospital). the free breakfast and free dinner were not at all palatable. i suppose that if you are traveling with a young family as many guests were, that makes this hotel a good value. but i would not stay here again.
deceptive	my husband and me reserved a room online for the chicago hilton. we were looking for a quit few days away from home and work. unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for. first of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos. the floors looked like they haven't been cleaned in a while in the check in area. the room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side. the staff was horrible. we had asked for a turn down service it was never received. i would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone. chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the hilton.
deceptive	i was very disappointed with this hotel. the front desk clerk was rude; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins. to get off the phone. when i arrived in the room the bed wasn't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty. i called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment(on the twelveth floor). once downstairs the clerk treated me as though i had done something wrong. when i arrived in the new room i found the bathroom less than clean... there was hair all over the floor, toilet and shower. the shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror. my allergies started to bother me, immediately upon entering the room, so i checked the filter in the air conditioner. which looked like it had never been cleaned.the comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum. while waiting on acceptable room i went to dinner. which proved to be as bad as the rooms. the lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy. the steak was rare and i asked for medium. not to mention, it tasted like rotten meat.the veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry. to top the whole experience off... when i went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay.
truthful	location is excellent, but don't valet your car there,(53.00 a day). bed was to soft, pillows were flat, we couldn't open up the mini bar cabinet because the bed was in the way. all in all not what you'd expect from a hotel in that area.
truthful	stayed over memorial weekend for 2 nites, 2 rooms. great hotel, we always love breakfast in morning,and drinks in even when applicable. around the corner from magnificent mile,and close to lots of restaurants. staff was great, we even checked in early before noon,and other room available less than hour later. fresh fruit was available to us,and bell guys are cool. suites are on small side compared to other homewoods but no complaints here, house cleaning kept our room clean,and we felt safe!
deceptive	i stayed at the affnia hotel in chicago and was extremely unsatisfied. i would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel. i paid $700 overall for 2 nights in a cheap, small, untidy room. granted, i've stayed at hotels of similar quality, but never have i paid so much for one of them! i could not believe what i saw when i walked into the room...it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall (that had been painted over). the breakfast i ordered wasn't terrible, but certainly wasn't good. the wifi connection was horrendously slow. if you want to spend a big buck on a hotel, fine...just don't spend it here.
truthful	thank god i got this hotel through priceline. i can't imagine paying full price for this place. the tub was moldy and dingy. the toilet didn't flush. their selection of tv channels was limited to say the least. unless you wanted to pay $5 for a rerun of an nbc show. oh, and internet? why that will set you back about $15 for the day. and breakfast? that's about $16 for a cup of coffee, a croissant and two slices of honeydew. this hotel is the pits. the customer service is....absent! when you walk in to the ridiculous lobby (decked out like some bad late 80's prom) there's no one to direct you upstairs to the check in. and once you're there, check in is very fast, i'll grant them that. this hotel is a big, crummy rip-off. i will never stay here (and will steer clear of hyatts in general i believe).
deceptive	"i would first like to say how inviting the rooms themselves are. for my wife and i, we enjoy the warmer colors. cleanliness along with excellent staff, made me feel away from home yet relaxed. being right downtown was perfect for location. the suites are very quiet as well. i surprised my wife with the ""shopping package"". what a hit! thanks homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown !!"
deceptive	very beautiful hotel. the historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing. this hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which i enjoyed the spacious, tidy rooms. the staff here are very friendly, helpful, and professional. the concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel. i especially enjoyed the service at the lockwood restaurant here. our server was excellent and the food was delicious! i must say this hotel exceeded my expectations. all in all, my stay was awesome!
deceptive	"my husband and i recently visited the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel on one of his business trips. i sometimes go along with him to see new places and to splurge on a mini-vacation while he is hard at work (don't worry- he likes when i return with little ""souvenirs"" for him, too). aside from the lovely city of chicago, this hotel was just amazing! we had gotten in quite late that evening from our flight from houston and were so tired! the staff was genuine and friendly, all while being professional and prompt. we were quickly checked in and before we knew it we were in our beautiful room. too tired to really take it in, we were in bed and asleep in minutes. the beds were quite welcoming! it wasn't until the next morning that we were able to really take in all of the beautiful features of this hotel! it's gorgeous! everything was so clean and wonderfully decorated! the lobby somehow didn't make it into our sleepy eyes the night before, but it was just lovely! later that evening we decided to eat at their sushi restaurant. sushi is one of my husband's favorites, so he tends to be picky. they passed the test according to him! we also enjoyed a glass of wine there as well... everything tasted great and was of excellent quality. of our two night stay there, the only downfall was one occasion of there not being enough towels (i use a lot of towels i suppose). however, a simple phone called prompted a quick delivery of fluffy additional ones. this however was only a minor bump in the road to an entirely enjoyable and relaxing stay! overall-- we'd love to go there again! maybe next time i can talk my husband into taking advantage of the spa... *wink*"
truthful	my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york. the room was very spacious and clean, the bed was huge and extremely comfortable. i really liked the aveda bathroom products, great smell. we had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot. compliments to the chef. the concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to navy pier, directions were given to us accompanied by a map. the weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show, this was spectacular. the whole of the last day of the show we spent at navy pier and the millenium park. location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping. if we are ever in chicago again we will definately stay here.
deceptive	if you're looking for luxuary, look no more. the conrad is the best. i was in chicago on business, and had to stay much longer than anticipated. a coworker suggested this hotel and boy am i glad he did. the location is perfect, you're close to everything. the best part is the conrad is a smoke free hotel. i'll be back soon. very satisfied
truthful	"we stay at the palmer house when we attend conferences in chicago. it is a stately building. but this year, there were ... problems we have not had before. first, they now have wi-fi available, but it is not free. the cost is $7.50 per hour. on-line it indicated that hilton hotels charge about $4, but this was almost double. many hotels have free wi-fi. wi-fi is wi-fi, so the level of service is not a factor that could justify this exorbitant cost. they also charge for their fitness center, even when you are only going to use the machines. there is no business center in-house for copies, etc. our bed was against a wall that separated us from the bathroom in the next room. it did not separate us from the bathroom noises. when someone took a shower (at 5:30 a.m.), the pipes ""sung"" like old pipes do,but very loudly. an empty wine glass sat outside someone's room door for days without being picked up by housekeeping. the concierge desk had only one person and there was always a line. if you called down, you were put on hold while they dealt with the people in the line. the staff were all very nice, and the location can't be beat, but the luxury prices for normal services felt like a ripoff this year. i doubt we'll return...."
truthful	"my family booked five nitghts at the omni chicago for our upcoming spring break. we took advantage of a pre-paid, non-cancellable offer. we subsequently received a ""bed & breakfast"" offer via email and immediately called the hotel to inquire whether we could switch our reservation (same dates, different offer). we called the 800' number and the customer services representative was so obnoxiously condescending and ignorant, we simply hung up. we had been looking forward to our vacation, but now i am not sure i made the right choice with this hotel. i should have paid closer attention to the reviews - the ritz, the four seasons, and the peninsula would have never treated us this way. i will post again after our stay on april 17th."
deceptive	i arrived to find that my room was not ready, despite it being past the 3pm check in time. i was not offered any compensation for this, or any real apology, just shunted off to the side to wait it out. this took a good hour and a half, during which time i was needing to be reading for a meeting. again, no apologies, just my card. the room was adequately clean (it had better be...) though sparsely furnished for the price. it did not feel very welcoming and the decoration was reminiscent of bad nights spent in hot, south coastal motels. i encountered several problems with on site amenities, both in room and out. some staff tried to be helpful on occasion but were rarely able to make headway, even when i complained on the third night about rowdy neighbors. it seemed as if where there was not apathy or cluelessness there was barely concealed surliness. after the abysmal (lack of) service at the hotel bar i elected to eat out every other night (i declined to try the room service, unimpressed with every other offering so far). i would not use this hotel for my business or personal trips.
deceptive	i booked a room at this hotel expecting great accommodations considering the price but was disappointed. the room looked nice, but i found that there weren't any extra blankets in the closet and the heating system was dysfunctional. i came back to the room after a meeting and found that it still had not been cleaned even though it was the late afternoon. i asked for replacement towels and they were very late in coming. i would have expected there to be a shuttle of some sort to the airport, especially since the website advertises the close distance. instead, i had to call for a taxi and was almost late for my plane because the taxi was stuck in traffic. all in all, not the best experience at all.
truthful	recently returned from a two-night stay at ambassador east hotel. was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in chicago. mission was accomplished. if you would like a quiet, comfortable hotel in a great area - this is it. while some of the furnishings show some signs of their age, it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home-like feeling. found staff to be friendly and helpful. we will be return guests many times in the future for sure.
deceptive	we stayed here for a weekend trip to chicago and we will come back and stay here again. it was great place front desk clerks were very helpful.also we loved the view. very nice quiet place and upto date and super clean. we will def stay here again highly recommended.
deceptive	my wife and i checked in to this hotel after a rough flight from los angeles. we decided to treat ourselves to a nice hotel while visiting our recently graduated son, and we were not disappointed. the location could not have been better, as we were afforded easy access to chicago's culture and shopping by being just off michigan avenue. after a long day of exploring the city, we enjoyed a fantastic dinner on the terrace overlooking the city. the halibut was cooked just right, and our waiter made us feel very welcome with some friendly conversation. overall, i would recommend this hotel to anyone traveling in chicago!
deceptive	first off, don't get a room on a lower floor, the garbage pick up makes a ton of noise and wakes you up at 6 am. then don't bother going down for breakfast at that time either, because the restaurant isn't open that early. when it finally opened, the breakfast arrived cold and late. nothing like congealed eggs to start your day. the fitness center had no towels and no cups for water. it was also too hot and too many people had sweated too much in it. after my congealed breakfast, it really was not pleasant. my entire three day visit was like that. i tried room service that night, but again, service was very slow and the food not warm when it arrived. my high speed internet was not so high speed when it would connect me at all. the furniture was run down and worn. pool towels were not always available. generally, for the price i paid, i would expect better service and a better maintained premises.
truthful	the hotel is beautiful. it is an excellent location. there was a few minor issues. the hotel is clearly geared toward the convention and business crowd. there were charges for almost everything, although i did not incur any of these. our room was a little small for the class of hotel, but not overwhelmingly small. not a true complaint, but the elevators were very slow. my comparison was that we stayed in an equally aged hotel in a different city during our trip, and the intercontinental's were significantly slower. that's it, no more little nit picks. the staff was excellent, the doormen being the highlight. the hotel bar was also very nice. the hotel was immaculately clean. i would definitely travel to this hotel again.
truthful	they rave about their beds but the beds were average. on surface room seemed clean, however, dropped my pen behind nightstand and discovered at least an inch of dust. it appeared there had been repairs to something where they had to cut away part of the wall. the repair job was covered up with a wallpaper board over the hole but the board did not even completely cover hole. impossible to have a decent shower or bath. extreme water saving devices on both the shower and tub provided basically a trickle of water. i was unable to get the shampoo out of my hair as pressure was so poor. also be prepared to be nickled and dimed to death. there was even a $10 charge if you used the coffeemaker in the room, really! for room service they tack on a delivery charge and a 20% gratuity. since the waiter does not stay to serve you how is he earning a gratuity. i have already been charged for him to deliver the food. the parking fees were outrageous at $51 a night but to add insult they charge a hotel patron the same fees as the general public. upon packing to leave we realized that the dvd set my son had brought was missing. i reported the theft to the hotel. had to file a report with security who promised me they would investigate and get back to me within 2 days. it has now been over two weeks. no follow up, no apology even given. we will never stay at this hotel again. we have been to chicago many times and this is the worst hotel we have ever stayed at.
truthful	"a disappointment to say the least. i have heard rave after rave about hotel allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an american express gift card that we decided to use for a night out! i called hotel allegro and made the reservation for a saturday night. the person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card, since they do indeed take american express. i couldn't wait to get there! we arrive at hotel allegro at about 3:00 on saturday afternoon. me, the tourist, i am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding. we get in the line to check in. i give them the gift card and my check card. they tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate, but for incidentals as well. we give them a credit card instead. while in line checking in, we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and i start to wonder what our experience is going to be like. the guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man. someone's luggage has been lost. he desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see. not impressed. we get to our little shoebox of a room that i was so disappointed to see. the rooms on the website looked glorious! my bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room. the sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room. yuck. we stay the night and go to check out in the morning. again, i give them the american express gift card. the clerk says ""their system usually doesn't take them"". i tell him that i called to confirm that their system would take it on friday. he swipes the card and bam! it works! what do you know?? he was so rude. i will not stay at hotel allegro again, nor would i recommend it to anyone. such a disappointment!"
deceptive	very nice hotel, better than expected. the hot breakfast is great in the morning, but the dinner at night goes above and beyond (even free wine!) the rooms are pretty good size, well furnished, and clean. i liked the view from my room. i used the fitness center and although did not have everything i would have liked, was adequate. i will say the pool is really nice and offers a pretty sweet view. the staff was friendly and helpful; being my first time in chicago they were able to point me in the right direction and saved me some frustration. i would definitely recommend this hotel.
deceptive	i just came back from this awesome, terrific hotel last week, and i have to say-- i loved it! my wife and i were there for a week due to a business meeting, and right when i stepped into the hotel, i knew that this business vacation will be well spent. the customer service was very great, and an employee even guided us toward our room! we were introduced to a fantastically lit room with 2 beds, a flat screen tv, and even free internet access. my wife loved it, and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap. when i headed down to the lobby for my conference, i got lost, and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held. he leaded me to the door, and i was very impressed. there is a fitness center which i went everyday, and this great restaurant called c-house situated nicely next to the hotel lobby, where i had a nice steak and my wife a salad. all in all, i thought that the trip was really worth it, and my stay was very welcoming at the affinia chicago. i highly recommend that whenever you visit chicago you should stay there, you will not regret it.
truthful	"this is a wonderful hotel with all the amenities. everyone was helpful. the breakfast buffet was wonderful. the bed was ""just like home"". we would definitely stay again. a nice touch was the water bottles left in our car for us to enjoy on our way home. it was little touches like this that make this hotel one of the best."
truthful	i just returned from a stay at this fabulous hotel - what a treat! the hotel website offers a great rate, and what i found was affordable luxury. i asked for a high floor & found myself with a fabulous view, in a room where there was an orchid spray in the bathroom, terrycloth robes and slippers, turndown service, roger gallet toiletries, a fluffy down conforter, and a wonderful pillowtop bed. the bathroom was so clean that it sparkled. the service was impeccable as well. even my room service breakfast was way above average with an incredibly generous basket of excellent croissants, brioches, & pain au chocolat. the decor was unique & the location convenient. check out the stunning flowers throughout the lobby. this is a topnotch hotel.
deceptive	"i booked my room at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers somewhat reluctantly; i was not enthusiastic about spending over $200 on this room after seeing the lackluster photos on their website. i was pleasantly surprised when i arrived that the lobby did not look as stuffy as it did online. unfortunately, my hopes were dashed once again when i arrived at my room. i say 'at' because after discovering my newly issued key was not working, i had to wait ten minutes before someone finally came to let me in. the room was painfully small-- if i didn't know better i would have thought i was staying at a red roof inn! the ""sweet sleeper bed"" had stiff and scratchy sheets, with a cheap-motel-thin coverlet. the disappointment continued after i entered the bathroom and found that it not only reeked of smoke, but also outfitted with the cheapest trimmings possible. i stayed my two nights, and was surprised to find out that all sorts of other charges were added to my room (for which i was not responsible), charged on demand movies, an empty mini bar, and for smoking in the bathroom. hah! i have stopped payment on my credit card, and most certainly will not be submitting myself to this horrific experience again."
deceptive	i think the sofitel chicago water tower is a upscale place.i had my wedding there and it was the best of the best.the staff was so helpful and made me feel confident that my wedding would be a success. the chef prepared a lavish sit down dinner with appetizers and desserts.they also had a wonderful pastry chef who baked my wedding cake.the tables were decorated in very good taste and could not be more perfect.the bar was also set up the way i wanted it and even had a champagne fountain. my guests had a wonderful experience with their stay at the hotel and felt pampered.the rooms were like suites with a mini bar.they had terry cloth bathrobes in each bathroom. if you are looking to have a wedding in the chicago area look into having it here you will not be disappointed!
deceptive	the swissotel chicago is a very mediocre hotel, the service is always poor, and the room service food always comes cold, unless it's supposed to be cold than it comes warm. i would rather stay at a super 8 than this place again.
truthful	"this is a great hotel, in a great location, in a great city !!! there's a cool bar area to the left of the main door when you can hang out and all of the staff are quite funky and look the part. the rooms are spacious and well thought out with a picture of some old rocker(s) in the bathroom ... i had the beatles and although they're not my cup of tea, i was happy enough with george staring back @ me! the hotel itself is on the corner of michigan ave and a short walk will take you to the fabulous shops and restaurants ... try the ""cheesecake factory"" or have a meal / cocktail on the top floor of the ""john hancock centre"". a slighty longer walk (or a short cab ride) and you're at the ""navy pier"" - take a ride on the ""seadog"" then enjoy all the fun of the fair ... or maybe a drink or two whilst listening to some great live music. this hotel (& city) is well worth checking out."
deceptive	it was my first time to visit chicago and i would say, i'd definitely go back, not just because of the air and water show that we really enjoyed, but most importantly, because of the hotel that we stayed in. the millennium knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests, but with pets too. at first i was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog, but i was surprised it turned out the other way. i've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that's really frustrating, it's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly. i would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit chicago.
truthful	i stayed at the fairmont to attend a conference. i was very pleased with the hotel. the doorman offered me an umbrella as i headed out for a walk... and sure enough it started to rain very soon after- i would have been soaked with it. upon my return, the doorman then asked about my walk, etc. this is reflective of all the staff i encountered. the front desk promptly checked me in. definitely register for their rewards program before you arrive... the complimentary gym access is excellent, plus you save on internet access fees which are waived for members. the bathroom and separate dressing areas were large and convenient. the only negative- no coffee maker! and the starbucks in the adjacent building is closed on weekends since the area corporate offices are closed those days!!! otherwise my stay was perfect, considering the conference rate was $99 per night!
truthful	"my son & i joined my husband on a work trip. we planned to swim while he was working. we overheard a lady asking when the pool would open as as we were checking in. though my son was eager to swim as soon as we checked in the pool was still closed at 630 pm. we gave up & went out for the evening. we had a very noisy sleepless night. we weren't facing mi ave, but still heard sirens and i'm not sure what the other noise was, but it sounded like a malfunctioning hand dryer in our ceiling that would sound off about 20x an hour throughout the entire night. i called the front desk the next morning and was told the pool was open, so my (very excited) son got his bathing suit on and we got to the fitness center only to be told by housekeeping that the pool was closed for construction. upon calling the front desk again the lady claimed she was unaware of the maintenance crew's actions & on my insistence she said she'd look into it. a gentleman called back an hour later & said the pool should open at 5pm...it was 9am. it is now 6pm & we still haven't even seen the pool. we check out tomorrow. we passed up time with grandparents who are in for the holiday to ""swim in chicago."" needless to say we are very disappointed."
deceptive	there is a great difference between a hyatt regency hotel, and a normal hotel. the thing that i did not like about this hotel was the smoke section of the non smoking section was really close to each other. i get really uncomfortable when i am in a crowded area, and people are smoking their lungs out. even though this hotel is really glamourous, has a nice bar, a nice restaurant, great music, it is still not a good stay if you don't like people smoking beside you.
deceptive	this hotel is absolutely beautiful. i is elegant, comfortable and a very relaxing stay. it was easy to get to the airport and very close to shopping. i felt like a king in a castle surrounded by luxury and beauty. i would recommend this hotel to anyone.
truthful	"this hotel does not live up to the reviews. the room was larger than i expected. however, the decor was a bit dated. the bedding was ripped, carpet was stained, and the shower door was broken. there was a long wait to the elevators, and if you're on floors 2-6 you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym. the main issue i had was the attitude i received from the staff. there was literally only one nice person at the front desk. there are no ice machines in this building, so you have to request it from the front desk. one day i requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person. 20 minutes later i made a follow up call because i did not receive my ice. i was nastily told that ice takes 10 minutes and i should just wait. i finally got the ice 10 minutes later. two days later i requested ice again. waited 30 minutes and just gave up. while i was leaving, i mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said ""i didn't get a call for ice."" well i obviously wasn't making it up, lady! i called and spoke with someone. she didn't even apologize or offer me anything. overall, i would not recommend this hotel. there are so many hotels in the chicago area. choose a different one."
truthful	i stayed at ich chicago for business in november of 2006 and loved it. as a royal ambassador member, they upgraded me to a beautiful junior suite with a separate living and working area and 2 bathrooms! my upgrade was in place upon arrival and a beautiful fruit basket was waiting for me on the coffee table. they even had a nice young lady escort me to my room. the suite was beautifully furnished and had an art deco feel to it. the only thing i regretted was that i only stayed one night. i will definitely stay here on my next visit.
truthful	i booked a hotel room for 4 nights at this hotel through an online vendor. after booking the hotel room i contacted the hotel to request a room with 2 beds. i was told in 3 different conversations with hotel personnel that i would have a room with 2 double beds. when i arrived i was given a king sized bed and was told that there was nothing the hotel could do for myself and my 3 guests. apparently the hotel management saw no problem with 4 people sleeping in 1 bed. the staff was completely unaccomodating. to add insult to injury we met other guests that had obtained a room with 2 beds by just walking in off the street the day after we checked in. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone. the customer service is well below what is acceptable. the location of the hotel is great but there are many other hotels that offer excellent service and high quality rooms to stay in while visiting chicago. bottom line is do not stay at the millenium knickerbocker!!!
truthful	for the price of the marriott we spent a night here ($122 + tax) and had an enjoyable if brief stay. as others have noted the hotel has been recently renovated, and the rooms are furnished with attractive and sleek scandanavian-type design. the staff was polite and attentive, and seemed to match the redesign with a hip kind of feel. the parking is pricey at $49, so i used an adjacent lot and self-parked, and as others have noted, the lack of water-pressue in the shower was disappointing. good location. would return, esp as this pricepoint.
deceptive	"this hotel was very overpriced for what you get from staying here. the amalfi hotel chicago advertises itself as a ""luxury hotel"" located in downtown chicago. since it is in downtown chicago, that means that i had street noises keeping me up most of the night. my view also suffered. they had nicer rooms available with better views, but the markups to stay in them was outrageous! the room itself was decent, with clean linens and nice air conditioning, but i can get that in just about any hotel these days. there wasn't anything particularly luxurious about the hotel to make it a stand-out for me, but for the price i paid for the room, i certainly had that expectation. it was a let down."
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hotel allegro chicago with my wife. i was on business but i thought i'd take her so we could see the city as well. chicago was great, the allegro...not so much. i mean it looked nice, great lobby and all. the service wasn't so great though. the clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude. like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. the bell hop took our bags to our room, none to gently. my wife and i watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. which wasn't that bad till he actually asked for a tip! our room was okay. the bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. the next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn't cleaned. our trip to the chicago had it's nice moments, all outside the hotel. the hotel allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better. i won't stay there again.
truthful	"i'd been searching for a cool, non-chain hotel for a weekend getaway with my boyfriend. i thought i'd found a winner in the affinia... soo disappointed!! in spite of the fact that our reservation was for two adults, we arrived to find our room had a double bed. what?! i was floored, but after a delayed flight and a 2 hour cab ride, was too tired to make a fuss. we were hungry after all the delays and planned on attending an event that night, so we called for room service hoping to keep it simple. i was told that room service would call me back to take my order...and nothing happened. i didn't want to be late to our event so we ended up going to the restaurant downstairs. nothing special; entree, dessert and nab for two still came out to $*...i am no hayseed, i'm well aware that everything costs more in chicago, but this just wasn't worth it. our room was by the elevator w/ parking garage view...the bathroom was tiny, shower curtain was stained, funky toilet seat/lid, and the vanity featured that ""rude awakening"" lighting normally found in low-rent dressing rooms, i.e., ""holy crap, have i looked that bad this whole time?!"" if you're a traveler who likes using the in-room coffeemaker, they charge for their chintzy coffees (i don't use these, but... come on). nice enough ambience in the upstairs bar, but weak drinks... that night, our bed was so tiny and uncomfortable that i almost asked to switch rooms. but the marathon was that weekend; the hotel was so busy i didn't want to be a pest. i can't believe i was so impressed with this place online. next time i'll happily pay more to stay someplace that's actually a treat."
truthful	two main issues: (1) understaffed from the street to the front desk. unfortunately i had to drive into the city, when i arrived there was an excessively long wait for parking. then inside, there was a huge queue line with just one clerk working in a big city hotel. not good (i will say friendly however) (2) i know this is a big city, but, $49 a night to park my car when i'm staying at that hotel? really?? that's unreasonable and a bit gouging in my opinion. again, i realize this is chicago, but, i'm already paying a hefty price for this outdated hotel.
truthful	i had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance, yet was given a room facing the street from which i could hear traffic noise. i asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day. the next morning, prior to being moved to a quiet room, the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood. about an hour later i was moved to a room which did not face the street. the room was quiet but smaller and darker. the mattresses in each room were very firm, i would even say hard. i asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same. at checkout i tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under, and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes, which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside, with other passengers. (the cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later.) as recompense for the noise, flood, etc., the hotel offered exactly nothing. not a great stay.
truthful	my first stay at this hotel and was expecting good things based on reviews. for some reason, i kept being disappointed at every turn. noisy room on the 4th floor. could not get the room to cool down - it was stifling. be warned - no water, no mini-bar no vending machine, no nothing once you get in your room. you might as well be in prison. they have coffee in the morning, but it starts at 6 so i had to wait both days. i guess that is convenient for them, but what about me? workout facility - pretty small but not the smallest. the only treadmill i could get on was broken. guess what a cooler with water in it! oh no - it was only stocked for one day. after that nothing. way to set expectations and then fail to deliver. same with towels - one day they have them - next day they don't. they essentially forced me to sign up for their loyalty program to avoid a riduculous $10 charge for wireless (go a few doors down to starbucks where it is free). they should fire the marketing moron who came up with that approach. i have stayed at much better for less. won't be coming back.
truthful	i travelled to illinois from the uk on business, and booked friday and saturday night at the homewood suites so that i could have a weekend in the city. the location was perfect, walking distance to michigan ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff, and literally 100 yards to the l (red line) for getting out to the surrounding areas. the room was great: not exactly 'wow' decor but clean and really well stocked. i was expecting a 'suite' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area. it was actually a 3-room mini-apartment, with an open lounge/kitchen, bedroom, and bathroom. two flatscreen tvs and a huge bed. breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover(!), and the kitchen meant that i could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed.
truthful	"wow. here is a place to never hold an event. first, no one smiles, including the bartenders. doesn't anyone here know they are in the hospitality business? the bartender was 54 years old. why do i know that? because, she stated to another employee that ""when you get to be 54 years old, you tell it like it is."" very specifically, she was referring to the fact that she could tell her employers how they should run things. wow. the room was set up the wrong way for the event. the food was just plain bad. $9 at a ponderosa would have been as good. however, this is the swisshotel. oh, let's go back to the bartender telling us, unsolicited, about all the problems with the hotel. man, you just have to wonder how a place like this stays in business. $50 for valet. ouch. anyone asking you if you need something, like help? no. does management make excuses? you bet. do you ever want to hold an event here? big no."
deceptive	"the talbott is definitely not worth the price you pay. i was really looking forward to staying here since it was recently renovated & was in a good location. unfortunately, it just didn't live up to the hype. ""recently renovated"" apparently means it was redone in the last decade, not the last year. it was just very tired-looking. also very disappointing was the food, and the service was hit or miss. i expected better from a hotel of this caliber. bottom line, there are better places with better value. stay elsewhere."
deceptive	i was not pleased with my recent stay at the palmer house hilton. my room was not ready upon my arrival and the room i was given was not what i had requested. i had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that. the air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off. the room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up. i wondered what had happened in the room before i got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener. there was no doorman available or a cart so i had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items. luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance. my room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff. they promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk i finally gave up. i had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that i spent to stay there.
deceptive	my stay at the omni chicago hotel was wonderful! i had a last minute business trip, in downtown chicago, and this is the first place i looked at. i looked at the pictures they show online of the rooms, and the facility itself, and i simply fell in love with the place. the indoor pool, outdoor sun decks, massages, this place really has all you could possibly need, whether you're on vacation, or needing a little stress relieved from a busy week. i mean they even have high speed wireless internet! i would definitely recommend the omni chicago hotel, if you want a great place to stay near downtown chicago!
deceptive	i had a great experience staying at the conrad chicago, the service was top notch, the price was good, but out of everything the service was outstanding. i would definitely stay there again when in the area and would suggest it to anyone looking for a good quality hotel in a great location. right next to the shops at north bridge!
deceptive	i had wanted to stay in this hotel since i had heard about how historic it is and i was highly disappointed with my stay there. the room that i was given was dirty and when i went back to the front desk to inquire about it, they disregarded my concerns. it took them a very long time to get me a new room and they whole time they were very unprofessional and did not make me feel welcome. i did not stay in the hotel all night since the people in the rooms around mine were unruly and were making noises all night long. i left that night but not before demanding a refund.
truthful	stayed 5 nights at this great hotel. updated rooms. clean. used tim to book theater and dinning reservations. provided excellent service. close to subway, shopping and dinning. excellent value. free wireless internet and access to nearby health club very nice perks. highly recommend it. future concern is adjacent construction of condos. not a problem while we were there but something to ask front desk about in the future.
truthful	i have stayed in the talbott a few times and had always liked it. this time was my first visit in 2 years and i was disappointed. the hallways are now looking tired and the carpets need to be replaced. i had asked for a corner room but instead was given a small and very dark room looking out onto a wall 10 feet away with multiple noisy vents immediately outside the window. the lights had to be kept on throughout the day even through the days were bright. the bathroom was tiny and would be difficult to manage with 2 people in the room. the ac unit rumbled on permanently with background white noise even when switched off. having stayed there before i know there are better rooms but this one was the same price as the others i have been in and the risk is getting it again. other small things contributed - the lobby brownies are no longer, there were no cup lids for the lobby coffee (so you couldn't walk out with the coffee) and i got a newspaper only on the last morning of a 5-night stay. the construction noise was not too bad but does start at 7.30am and goes on until around 8pm, including weekends.
deceptive	fantastic stay! the hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean. i chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was very close to my business conference. here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown chicago charm. be sure to try the ribs at south water kitchen next door. they are the best i've ever had. ever! if youre in the mood to unwind, you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around. i had a great time here. from now on, i won't stay anyplace else.
truthful	what a fabulous hotel! from its location directly on the magnificant mile and surrounded by the finest shopping, to the curtious staff and excellent restaurants and bars, this hotel is one of the best in chicago. our room was very clean and fresh, the public areas comfortable and the staff at the concierge and front desk very extremely helpful. this is the only place to stay to be in the cnetre of the action in chicago. highly recommended!
truthful	my wife and i redeemed some of my hilton reward points to stay a few nights at the palmer house. the hotel is absolutely beautiful. from the moment you walk into the lobby you can tell that this place is nice. as we were diamond members we got upgraded to a suite which was great because we were provided access to their executive lounge (free food & drinks). the service was excellent and the location of the hotel is within walking distance of many sights on the south side of chicago. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone interested in coming to chicago.
truthful	my husband and i were very excited to be staying at the conrad, unfortunately, we would never stay in this hotel again. the rooms looked nice, but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink. the room service cost was super high - costing us over $100 for 1 burger, 1 order of french toast, 2 pops and 2 desserts. in the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake. we called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room (we were on the 5th floor, same as the reception desk). they did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower. the staff was friendly enough, but not helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems. there was not even a coffee pot in the room. definitely would not stay here again for the price. not worth it!
deceptive	i really loved my stay at the talbott. my room was amazing! the bathroom (and i am very picky about hotel bathrooms) had ample room for all of my stuff, which is a bonus for me. the staff treated me really well and they were very friendly. i was afraid that i'd get a little lost, since it was my first trip to chicago, but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area (rush st./michigan ave.-- which are *very* close by). the hotel reminded me of those i'd stayed at in europe. the room service is 24 hours, which for me, was a bonus because i am up mostly during the nights. this is the *only* place i will ever stay if i visit chicago again. for a single woman traveling alone to a strange city, this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable.
deceptive	when you enter the lobby at the millennium knickerbocker hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered. the staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can. the check in process is smooth and friendly as i expected. when you enter your room the decor catches your eye. luxurious yet not stuffy is how i describe it. the restroom tub is large and made of marble. the whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home. i highly recommend the millennium knickerbocker hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while.
deceptive	i had such high hopes when i booked a stay at the knickerbocker hotel in chicago a few short weeks ago. when i arrived i should have known things would not be as i expected them to be. the host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that i was there. when i finally got checked in and arrived in my room i found that the temperature in the room was far too hot. the air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot, muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room. i turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down. since i arrived in the early afternoon i decided to order room service from the nix restaurant that is in the hotel, i ordered the gooey triple decker grilled cheese, at $14 i was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich i had ever eaten. when it finally arrived, more than an hour later, it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey! it also comes with a bowl of tomato bisque soup which, needless to say was also cold. for the quality of the food, $14 was way too much to pay for this meal. after a meeting with clients we stopped by the martini bar for drinks. the waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve. needless to say it took forever to get our drinks. we heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well. finally we got our drinks, we all ordered a french martini. we all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered, it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very, very tart. at $14 each you would think it would be made to perfection, far from it. the evening finally over i went back to my room where i now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have. after a miserable night i checked out glad to be done with the knickerbocker hotel!
truthful	stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09. chechecked in about 9:15 am. had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests i had made. room was quiet, and comfortable. marked improvement over last time i stayed there (about 5 years ago). the renovations were great, and maintained the old time charm of the hotel.
deceptive	from the moment i stepped into the hotel i felt like i was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me. checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly. i only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room, which i loved since i had just had quite a long flight, and made sure i had everything i needed before wishing me a happy stay in the hyatt regency chicago. after settling in and resting for a while i called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant. overall my experience was very positive and i would be glad to return to the hyatt upon my next visit.
truthful	i have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to chicago. it is a very nice hotel, and i will love to stay there if i visit chicago again! there is a lot of positive to say about the hotel; staff is excellent, never experienced such an excellent service -- that alone is worth coming back for. was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast. a few things that could make this hotel even better... a hand shower in the bathroom. the hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom, instead of the bathroom, when the bathroom is all damp after a shower i prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair. free internet access in the lobby. i was surprised i had to pay 6 or 7 usd (for 15 minutes) to log-on and check-in with my airline (only with a few airlines you can check-in without paying?!?!?!?)
deceptive	the james hotel in chicago was a huge let down. i was expecting a truly spectacular experience. on the website it appears to be an absolutely fabulous state of the art hotel. well, my family's bad experience started right when we walked in the door. it turns out the room we had reserved had been given to someone else, and the man at the front desk was extremely rude. we had to wait for an hour for the house keeping service to prepare a new room for us. the room had an odd smell and we had to ask for towels and hand soap as they weren't already in the room. the one thing that was good about the place was the fabulous gym. all in all, i feel that we paid way too much for what we got. next time i will look to stay somewhere else.
deceptive	friendly staff, clean building and rooms. the hotel was located nearby everything we were interested in seeing. staff was willing to help give directions and very knowledgable of city. rooms were beautifully designed and well lit, spacious and comfortable.
deceptive	my husband and i recently stayed at your hard rock hotel in chicago, and what a fantastic experience it was. we stayed in one of the 'extreme suites' and let me tell you it was beautiful. the furniture and paintings were amazing and the view was to die for. the staff treated us really well and met all of our needs and then some. i especially loved the spa. we stayed for a week but i could have stayed a lot longer. it was very comfortable and welcoming. we will make sure to recommend your hotel to our friends and will be back the next time we are in chicago. thanks so much!
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago, il. from the start, the experience was bad. the room was filthy, there were no towels, and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation. i will never stay there again. i could not have been more dissatisfied.
truthful	"hotel monaco is in a really great location, only a block away from the miracle mile and a couple of blocks from millenium park. sears tower is also well within walking distance and if you don't mind walking you won't have a problem walking to greek town and lincoln park (we did). the daily, complimentary, wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out. if you can, leave your car behind, you won't need it and the parking is quite pricey, which is not very surprising considering the location. everything was clean, fresh and modern and the staff very helpful. the only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around ""the loop"" was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid's supply room so it was quite busy in the morning."
deceptive	i just got back from the monaco in chicago! i was very pleasantly surprised, as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway, and he usually picks bad places-haha. anyway, the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated. it was busy and the line was a little long, but it moved quickly. the lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good, especially since it seemed to be near full. the room was clean and spacious (especially considering it's a city hotel). we made a lot of use of the concierge, since again, it was so last minute we didn't really make any plans. he gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for chicago pizza yummy! it was also great being near the theater district, and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare. i thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room! very trendy. my husband is not as easily impressed, but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon. overall, really nice stay in a four star, or probably four and half star hotel!
deceptive	i stayed at swissotel chicago for 1 night while on vacation with my girlfriend. our plan was to stay 3 nights there originally but its beauty could not make up for the poor service we received from the front desk associate. we walked in and despite being the only guests waiting to check in, we still stood waiting for 10 minutes while the person at the desk chatted on the phone with someone who was clearly not related to the hotel. once me leaning against the counter finally got her attention, she got off the phone and acted like i was the one at fault. needless to say i will not be staying here again.
deceptive	my family's seven day stay at the intercontinental chicago hotel was more than i could ever imagine. the intercontinental is more fantastic than any previous hotel i have visited, because of its wonderful amenities, such as the excellent 24 hour room service, access to personal trainers,and even a dry cleaning service, just to mention a few. my family really enjoyed dining on the contemporary american cuisine at the hotels zest restaurant, which served an excellent meal worth every dime of its reasonable price. my most favorite point about the intercontinental chicago is that it provides entry right into the windy city, where my family and i had immediate access to transportation, shopping, and city attractions. we had a great time traveling through chicago and enjoying ourselves while at the same time we felt secure knowing that we had a nice, clean, elegant, safe hotel to travel back to whenever we were done touring the city each day. the intercontinental is a must stay and i will recommend them to anyone who plans on visiting chicago.
truthful	we went to chicago to see an exhibit at the art institute and selected the fairmont because it was so close. although the lobby is still being renovated, our experience at the hotel was uniformly positive. the room was nicely sized and newly remodeled and immaculate. the only glitch involved getting the room coffee replenished. the maid does not do that, and by bedtime on the first night, we still didn't have coffee. we called the front desk and they immediately delivered a fresh supply. the restaurant is a little underwhelming, but with so many other places to go within a very few blocks, we probably wouldn't have eaten there any more than we did. after having stayed in close to a dozen different chicago hotels, this may be the hotel we return to whenever we return.
truthful	we were disappointed with this hotel. the staff seems hurried and unhelpful. our room was not made up until after 5 pm despite several requests. the blower in the hallway blew freezing air, but the staff told us that there was nothing that could be done about it. the lobby is not inviting and there is no where comfortable to sit. the room and bed was comfortable, but the cream and and modern art work are not our style. the room lacked many of the amenities other hotels in this price range offer. certainly not worth the rate compared to other hotels i have stayed at in chicago.
deceptive	i would not reccomend staying at the hard rock hotel chicago if you want a good deal and a good nights sleep. i stayed at the hard rock hotel chicago for two nights this past july. i had a select king city view room. the room was dark, with ugly black carpets and the view was of another building right next door - not a great view. i was on an upper level floor and the elevators were incredibly slow. the hotel was pretty loud and the people in the room next to mine were up partying all night long, so it was very hard to get to sleep on my first night there. when i called to complain at the front desk they promised to do something about it but never did. i ended up having to call two more times before the management did something about the room next door. they quieted down for about an hour, but then were loud again for the rest of the night. the hotel was expensive, and for the price there weren't very many special amenities. there was no continental breakfast and the wifi was not included -- you had to sign up for a day of service at $10 a day. overall i would not recommend staying at the hard rock hotel chicago, as it is way overpriced for what you get.
deceptive	if you have the money, amalfi hotel is the place for you. all the way from it's 316 thread count, egyptian linens to the 24 hour fitness center. this hotel has anything you would need or want. the rooms are equipped with free wi-fi, 32in plasma televisions, multi-head showers and much, much more. you can do anything from fine dining and wine to working on the computers in the business center, which is equipped with computers free to your use. after a long night at the bar, you can get a complimentary breakfast at each floor. over all the service is great as well. i recommend this hotel to any one from business professionals to young singles looking for a good time. i plan on coming back very soon.
truthful	"we stayed here because of the enthusiastic positive reviews on trip advisor and yelp. we might have had a one in a million experience, but we: - were served a hairy salad (a long black hair held a lettuce leaf hostage); - considered our guest room tiny; - could not submerge a thigh, much less a body, in the tub (we're not obese and we're not dexter); - endured a broken air conditioner for days (it couldn't be repaired); - experienced the delight of an inexplicably broken toilet (they fixed it that day). on a positive note, the tea from room service tasted delicious, employees were abundant and friendly, the location is great, and it's very easy to get a taxi. in the future, i would reluctantly stay here for business. i would not stay here for pleasure. i think a 20-something who hasn't traveled much would appreciate this hotel more than a seasoned traveler would...as a friend said to me today, ""oh, the sofitel? that's the hilton of france."" i agree."
deceptive	"hotel is placed in downtown chicago what makes it really loud, it is hard to sleep during the night because all the ""city""noises coming from the outside. the rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures. i stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband, and we supposed to get room with king size bad, but instead we got, two single beds. the stuff isn't really very nice either, they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you."
deceptive	hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you're traveling with luggage and/or kids. they seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees. rooms feature either double or king sized beds; no queen beds at all. if you want a little extra leg room in your bed, the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff. rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge, too.
deceptive	"we stayed at the omni chicago hotel recently and had a great experience! my husband and i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting downtown chicago. we are frequent travelers who are used to staying in well-maintained, luxury properties with many amenities and the omni chicago definitely fit the bill. first of all, the hotel is all suites. we stayed in one of the ""premium suites"". the accommodations were definitely luxurious, with premium bedding, very nice robes for our use, and a choice of pillows. we used the hypo-allergenic ones, but i believe you could have also chosen foam or feathers. we were pleased to find that the tv was plasma, we have found that not all hotels have upgraded to plasma and we don't wish to use one of the old-fashioned type of tvs anymore now that we are so used to plasma at home. there were actually two tvs in our suite. there were also some additional amenities that we appreciated such as high-speed internet access, a wet bar, an indoor swimming pool and two gorgeous sundecks for relaxing outside. the location was perfect as it was right in the midst of the miracle mile, with so much to do practically at the omni's doorstep. i also treated myself to the windy city massage, which was done in the comfort and luxury of our suite. the masseuse was excellent and she used very high-quality products for my sensitive skin. it was extremely relaxing and i was so pleased to find out that i could get this at the omni. it was easy for us to see why the omni came so highly recommended. i also wanted to mention that the staff was very helpful and friendly, recommending several excellent area restaurants. however, we think our best meal was at the omni's 676 restaurant, where my husband raved about the bone-in ribeye and i had the carrot soup and the lake erie silver bass. they had an extensive wine list and we were easily able to choose wines we loved with the staff's guidance. lastly, the hotel staff also highly recommended we visit the nearby art institute of chicago, which was a highlight of our trip. we loved that there were multiple museums so close to the omni! we will be frequent visitors at the omni in the future, where i will definitely be getting the in-room massage again. we are going to pass this recommendation on to all of our friends and family - choose the omni for a great chicago experience!"
deceptive	the conrad chicago was by far the best experience i have ever had in travel leisure. not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable, but the food in the restaurant was exquisite. not to mention the perfect service from the resort's employees! i was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs. i'm naturally a fitness freak, so i was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor. best of all, it was available to guests at any time, day or night. the resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area, so it wasn't a far walk to scope out the shops. the most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous chicago looks all lit up. it was so relaxing just watching the city come to life. i was very disappointed when i had to pack and leave. any time that i make my way back to chicago, you better believe i will be staying at the conrad chicago. i recommend this resort to everyone i know who does a lot of traveling.
deceptive	my husband and i visited the fairmont chicago millennium park for our honeymoon. the customer service was amazing. from the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing. these people were proficient, respectful and very thoughtful. the fairmont had a lounge, a wine room, a bar and a restaurant. i couldn't decide where i wanted to go first! after we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room... it was totally delicious. we also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon! then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa, once again excellent!! everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time. we stayed in the gold room. although it was a little bit smaller than i thought it would be i was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows. my husband and i relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city. it was a wonderful experience that i will never forget. four thumbs up!
deceptive	i stayed at sofitel with my husband for a weekend and i will never be staying again! the staff was rude, the room was dirty, and the decor is ugly and garish. avoid at all costs!
deceptive	after booking a room over two months in advance at the hotel sofitel chicago watertower and confirming my reservation twice, i arrived to find that the front desk staff had 'no record' of my reservation and that the only rooms available were much more expensive than the room that i had reserved. when i asked to speak to a manager, it took almost half an hour for him to turn up. he did finally give me a room at the rate that i had been promised, but did not offer any compensatory discount or bonuses for my inconvenience. the room itself smelled of dog but was otherwise okay. not worth the rate though. the website really makes this hotel seem upscale, clean, and well decorated, but the rooms are not in the style that you would expect from the lobby. the staff's response to my request to move to another room because of the obvious dog smell (which could only mean it hadn't been cleaned properly) was met with contempt. they did move me, but i did not get an apology. will not stay again.
deceptive	what a gorgeous hotel! from the moment we stepped inside the warm colors of the lobby made us feel welcome at the sheraton and in chicago. the heavenly beds made the view from our room that much better, and to top it off with great restaurants, you couldn't ask a hotel for more! starbucks coffee in the rooms were just an extra touch that guarantees we'll be back every time we visit chicago.
deceptive	the swissotel chicago is a delight to visit. located in downtown chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste. they have children friendly rooms as well as the exquisite presidential suite. rooms have exceptional views of downtown chicago. this hotel also has a penthouse fitness center and pool for entertainment. other places to stop by to eat is the palms, geneva and the lobby lounge.
truthful	"my husband and i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel & towers in february. everything about the hotel and experience was superb. the location was wonderful as well. our room overlooked the river and we had a great view of the lake towards navy pier. the best part of the stay was the ""sweet sleeper"" bed. it was so comfortable. the staff was friendly and helpful as well. nothing bad to say about this sheraton! i will stay here again!"
truthful	october 3rd, 2007 my wife and i stayed at the sofitel toward the end of september 2007. the hotel is very modern. the room was immaculate, but the furiture looked as though it came from ikea. it was chipped in many places. the light switches were difficult to find, and the hvac made noise. however, the bed was wonderful. the bathroom was large and well maintained. housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted. the restaurant was small. you can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called tempo. if you want a truly great breakfast try the peninsula hotel. however, after dining there you might not want to return to the sofitel. prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full. when we checked in, we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals. upon returning home, we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the sofitel had an authorization placed on it. this reduced the line of credit, and it took several days to be removed from the card. great location! reasonable value. if you have a privilege card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon.
truthful	we have been for the first time in chicago and stayed in the swissotel for five nights,a wonderful place.room was on the 29th floor,absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview.breakfast perfect and service really good.people were always helpful.it's a little bit far from magnificent mile and the loop,but in front of the hotel there are buses (number6)waiting there next turn,not a real bus stop,but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus.next time going to chicago we will again stay in the swissotel.
truthful	from checkin to departure a poorly run hotel. it took 30 minutes in line to check in because only one clerk was on duty. another person, perhaps the manager, was in the back room but never came out to help the check in clerk even as the line grew. the hotels elevators are small resulting in 10 minute waits to get up and down floors,especially when 1 of the 3 breaks, as seems to be frequent occurence. after specifically asking for a room away from the elevators, i was assigned to a room directly across from them, necessitating another 20 minute wait in line. the room smelled of mildew and water dripped from the ceiling the first night. i requested a news paper be delivered to my room - it appeared on the morning and never again. basically, the hotel is understaffed and poorly trained. never again !
truthful	the sheraton was a wonderful hotel! when me and my mom flew in we were really tired so we decided to take a quick nap. we didnt want to get up! the beds are absolutely to die for. i wanted to take it home with me. the service was great and this was probably one of the biggest if not the biggest hotel ive ever stayed in. they had a really nice restaurant inside with excellent food.
deceptive	amazing! i was swept away when i walked into the hotel it was gorgeous. the staff was very nice and helpful the hotel was very clean, and the food was delicious. we stayed two nights and the first night we went to the lockwood restaurant and we were blown away by the food. it has to be the best food in chicago the atmosphere was very classy and warm and the wait staff was very precise. the decor in our rooms did not look like any hotel i had been at they were very elegant and inviting. i cannot wait to go back it is a true escape from daily life.
truthful	very friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever ? you may have. don't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar. spacious rooms. perfect for business and for theatre guests. a little quiet area during weekends.
truthful	"my expectations were not high because i booked this hotel through priceline for $58 / night. an amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait 15 - 20 minutes for hot water. i called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water - to which they nonchalantly replied: ""try running it for 15 to 20 minutes."" they forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower, if anyone else expected to use the shower. my boyfriend, who showered after me, had to wait another 10 minutes to get the shower warm again. to make matters worse, after room service was delivered, we called and said we needed another fork. they told us it would cost $3 ($1 for the fork, $2 for delivey charge). absolutely ridiculous!! at least with a 1 star hotel, you get hot water. this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel. i guess you do get what you paid for - i just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price."
truthful	"swissotel continues to be a *yawn* as previous posters state, punching in your floor is ridiculous. on the other hand, technology wise it could be helpful in routing ppl to different elevators (but if idiots like to cram into one elevator and leave the others free for me, why change)? in any case, i want to take a nice hot soak and--guess what--they are having water problems... sooooo disappointed. hopefully i don't get bug bitten this time (checked under the sheets). sadly, due to my company's deal, i think i have to stay here again next year *sigh*...but so far they are batting 1 star.... -------------- oh boy, it must be my luck...or rather this hotel is just run down. i had to swap room four times. and that's for a thurs nite-sunday morning stay. my first room had no hot water so i had to switch rooms. they gave me the key to the 2nd room, which happened to be occupied. luckily the occupants had their security latch on, so there wasn't any embarrassing moment. my third room was fine for 2 nights but then today (just now) i had to move because of water leakage (above my room and below my room). boy, talk about an awful hotel (or my just awful luck???? maybe it's karma since i wrote a bad review last year, and continue to write one...but it's the truth). oh, also last year may not have been bed bugs. i have checked the room and it looks bug free but i still get these itchy patches on my leg. perhaps it is something in the sheets...or the air/hvac.... in any case, despite the decent staff, it is a one at best (0 for hotel, 1 for the still nice service--since it's not their fault....) all i can say is ...thank goodness my company won""t hold the conference in chicago next year, or at least at this hotel!!!!!!!!"
truthful	"our suite at the knickerbocker are quite nice, but the behavior and attitude of the staff is beyond abysmal. first, a member of the staff entered our room mid-day unannounced only to apologize after realizing that he failed to verify that we were present. not a tremendous problem, but when the young woman at the front desk replied ""what do you want me to do about it"" with the tone of a flippant teenager, i began to suspect that a severe deficiency in manners may have been evident in the staff. fast forward to this evening. following a lovely meal off the premises, we chose to turn in a bit early at 11:30 pm only to discover that despite our best intentions, the bass from a party downstairs was more than audible in our room. acting prudently and with restraint, we decided to phone the front desk to inquire as to why our room had been inadvertently annexed into the party downstairs, but yet again we were met with a curt and quite rude response. sean at the front desk informed us that the party was a greater priority for the hotel, and that the family dictated that the music was to be set at a certain volume. on one hand i appreciated his honesty, but on the other, i truly would have preferred that he at least pretended to care about the guests who chose to stay at his property. since we're out of options for the evening, we've decided to stay up and try to watch tv for the time being, but given the circumstances, the staff could have easily made up for the negative situations that arose in quick succession. also, i was alarmed to learn that while i slept the prior night, a possible gang-related shooting took place mere blocks from the property. this wouldn't have been a concern if like nearby hotels, the knickerbocker chose to enlist any type of security measures within their lobby. would i stay here again? maybe on a dare, or if someone else was footing the bill. yet i've had better experiences in road side motels, and the employee training regimen could use a serious revamping to better serve the interests of the guests, and more importantly simple common sense."
truthful	"the allegro in downtown chicago is a great stay/ part of the kimpton group boutique hotels the allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'el' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are ""class acts"""
deceptive	the palmer house hilton hotel has it all for the business and leisure traveler out there! i stayed at this hotel on business and all i can say is wow!!! one of the main things that i liked about the hotel was the indoor pool! i loved being able to go swimming even though it was december and 5 degrees outside! also, the hotel does offer wireless in the room and this really came in handy for me to keep up with my work after my meetings. i dined at lockwood restaurant and bar and the food was amazing for a hotel! one thing that was a minor negative is that pets are allowed and my original room was next door to a barking dog, but the hotel staff was fantastic as switched up my room so i didn't have to deal with that! all in all, this hotel was fantastic and i look forward to the next time i get to stay here!
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago during labor day weekend, huge mistake! when i got to my room everything seemed okay,until i went into the bathroom. there was a steady drip noise coming from the bathroom sink and no matter how hard i turned the knob, it would not stop. there was none of the usual bath soap nor was it stocked with any toilet paper. it also seems that housekeeping just swept everything behind the toilet as i saw a wad of hair, and scraps of tissue behind the bowl. i called the front desk and ask them to send someone up to stock the bathroom and clean it. while i was waiting i turned on the air conditioning because it was kind of warm in there.... the a.c. started blowing out hot, musky air and had the room smelling horrible. i made another phone call to front desk and complained and asked them to switch my room. they told me all they had available was a double bed and it was near an elevator. i was so frustrated between the odor and the steady drip i was hearing i had no choice but to take it. when i moved to the new room, there was now a large damp spot near the window which smelled very strongly of beer and the light in my bathroom would not turn on. front desk once again sent someone to my room to fix the problems and finally 2 hours later, i was able to relax and settle in. hard rock is definitely not what it used to be and for that reason, i will not be staying there again.
truthful	triple a rate with upgrade to view room was less than $200 which also included breakfast vouchers. had a great view of river, lake, wrigley bldg. & tribune bldg. most major restaurants, shopping, sightseeing attractions within walking distance. large room with a very comfortable bed.
deceptive	i enjoyed my stay at the ambassador east hotel in chicago. the staff was friendly and helpful from the time i checked in all the way through checkout. the hotel was very clean and well maintained. the beds were very comfortable! the hotel restaurant/lounge was very cozy and a nice way to unwind after a long day. the only thing i was unhappy about was the fact that internet service is not complimentary at this hotel. i reccomend this hotel and i will stay there again on my next trip to chicago!
deceptive	last weekend my wife and i decided to take a weekend trip to chicago. when looking for a hotel we weren't all that interested in price, but more of a relaxing getaway in the heart of downtown. i did some research and and came across the amalfi hotel chicago. what sparked my interest was it's location and the fact that they offer in room spa treatments. located in chicago's river north area, it is close to the magnificent mile so we can get all of our shopping done while staying relatively close to the hotel and also do some sightseeing along the chicago river on one of many chicago boat tours, both of which were fantastic! after a long day out on the town we came back to the hotel to induldge in their in room spa treatments. my wife got the whole works (facial, manicure and pedicure, and hot stone massage therapy), while i enjoyed a deep tissue massage to get rid of some of the pain from walking around all day! for dinner we went downstairs and enjoyed a fabulous dinner at harry caray's italian steakhouse. best steak i've ever had, hands down. when we were finished with dinner we just wanted to go back to our room and relax so we hopped into our comfortable king size bed, put in a movie with their in room dvd players and beautiful 32 inch hdtv's. for anyone looking for a nice relaxing getaway to the great city of chicago, i would recommend the amalfi hotel chicago to anyone. they offer anything you could ever want in a luxury hotel plus more.
deceptive	"the name ""hard rock"" might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here. the website alludes to musicians and parties but if you're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the hard rock falls short. the hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this. the service is mediocre and the rooms aren't clean. i stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun, exciting romance. i should have picked somewhere else. save your money."
truthful	the conrad hilton recently took over this property from the failed meridian hotel. it seems that the conrad has inherited a hotel property that just doesn't work. the entrance is very difficult to find. there are only two elevators to take you up to the lobby. as a result, there was often a line waiting for them. the same problem affects the guest room elevators located beyond the registration area. if you go in and out of the hotel more than a couple of times during your stay, you will find the poor elevator layout annoying. the king room is what i would consider small compared to other chicago hotels. although i like modern design, the room was quite stark and cold. it was also showing quite a bit of wear and tear. the bathroom was the best part. has anyone from management tried to sit in the chair and work at the desk? it was the most uncomfortable set-up i've experienced. the views are non-existent for most of the rooms. in a city with amazing vistas, this was disappointing. i saw a couple walking the halls with management trying to find a room that was acceptable to them. room service breakfast was a highlight of our stay. excellent food and high quality presentation. sorry i couldn't write a better review. would i stay here again? no. chicago has some incredible hotels and this is not one of them.
truthful	we have stayed at several high end places in chicago and this is still our favorite. location is superb, staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying. cornell, at the front desk, is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge. we love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program, high speed internet is gratis, as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing. bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains! we have never had a bad stay at this hotel.
truthful	after reading the reviews on this hotel, i decided to book my stay for july 4th weekend here and i am glad i did, this hotel is absolutely beautiful. our suite was gorgeous it is a very romantic hotel with big sit in picture windows. i do have 1 complaint. the bar is very boring and the resturant is not that great, but other than that i loved it. i would definitely stay there again.
deceptive	this hotel was not at all what i expected it would be. the website and it's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in. the amenities were not what i was looking for, and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. my aaa membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. the staff was not very friendly or helpful when i had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. i understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while i was there, but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service. i don't think i will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon.
truthful	ambassador east is an awesome hotel!!! understand that this hotel is full of history and is a boutique hotel. my family stayed at the ambassador for two nights in a suite. very clean room with great space. the best part of the ambassador is not the rooms though. the staff was extremely courteous, especially the concierge. if you stay here you have to go to the pump room. the restaurant is full of nostalgia, the staff is great, and the food is excellent. great atmosphere and music.
truthful	what's not to like? --> problems getting the room you actually reserved: i had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved. --> overcharging. they charge for everything here. wireless. the fitness center. the business center. i've only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center. note to the intercontinental: if you're going to charge for something that is commonly included, you should advertise that fact. what's next? charging for sheets on the bed? --> very poor customer service. the staff does not communicate in full sentences, or wait to hear your answer. this is chicago, not new york. how about a little midwestern patience?
deceptive	"the amalfi hotel chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay. when arriving at the hotel my party and i had over a 20 minute wait just to check in. we were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their ""private"" counter that their website highlights. it felt as though i was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in. not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever, but our reservations were completely wrong. i ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when i had reserved a smoking king room. not having the room i requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel. i was not compensated for having to switch rooms and audrey our experience designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze. i recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area. the amalfi hotel chicago is a waste of time and money as far as i am concerned especially when i could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort. don't waist your time staying here."
deceptive	stayed at this hotel for labor day weekend and it was pretty awful. the staff were relatively friendly, but that's where the positive aspects stop. bed was rock hard and very uncomfortable. thermostat didn't work properly and the air conditioner was always 5 degrees warmer or colder than what you wanted. even though i think $10 for 1 day of internet is ridiculous, i bought it because i needed to download a powerpoint for work and send off a few emails. it was ungodly slow and barely better than dialup. i ended up finding a starbucks to use their wifi so i could actually get something done. minibar was overpriced, as expected. awful experience, definitely wouldn't stay here again.
truthful	just got back from 2 days up in chicago shopping with girlfriends. first time i have stayed at the omni. i did so because i saw a $129.00 rate that included $25.00 of free food on travelzoo. the three of us (55 year olds) all stayed in one suite with 2 double beds and a very comfortable pull out sofa. we had plenty of room. food in the restaurant was great, service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with, early morning delivery of free coffee, juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat, time of movies, shopping areas, etc was really helpful. need i mention the outstanding location? simply the best! we all decided that the omni is our new favorite hotel.
truthful	"very disappointed in our stay in chicago monoco. we have stayed many times elsewhere, primarily in washington dc and are accustomed to great customer service, beverages like water or soda at the wine bar, coffee and papers in the morning, help with bags. not only did the chicago monoco do none of these things, the staff was not helpful, either. requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there. you got the feeling you were ""bothering"" people if you asked a question. no bellman, the doorman did not open the door or help with bags. even though we were traveling with a child, i had to request a fish when they did not bring it. really baffling.. as we love the monoco in washington."
deceptive	the chicago hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic. the hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city. the room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful. i can't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there.
deceptive	our vacation was highlighted by a four day stay at homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown.i believed it would be the best part of the trip; i discovered it was an unfolding nightmare. while in our lovely room on the fifteenth floor, a voice emanating from the phone, informed us of the pending fire alarm and what procedures to follow. anyone above the tenth floor was instructed to go into the bathroom, wet towels and place them along the bottom of the closed door.do not use the elevators and wait for further instructions.we nervously waited for twenty minutes without any further communications from the voice in the phone.we then decided to exit via the stairs, realizing too late that once you entered the stairwells, doors behind you were locked.we continued to travel downward, against the backdrop music of sirens and loud muffled speakers.obviously, we were rescued without any physical injuries; yet emotionally we were damaged.i now choose my hotels in the range of ten floors or less.
deceptive	my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel last month for my son's wedding. when we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to valet our car. after waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip, which i found rude. after finally getting to our room i noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom. i was extremely disappointed with the room and the service. i will not recommend this place to anyone.
truthful	we got an outstanding rate by signing up for the hotels' website newsletter. affinia has a great location just off michigan avenue near the water tower. beware however: parking is expensive in the gold coast....$48/night. right from the start, victor greeted us and made us feel welcome. check-in was easy and our room was gorgeous. however, it was a handicapped acessible room and i wanted a tub, so one call to the front desk and we had another room. all rooms have been renovated and they are beautiful, comfortable and well appointed. the rooftop bar is a must-do. the outside patio has heaters and candles, a high table for big groups and little groupings of chairs and sofas to get comfy on and enjoy the views. we didn't sit inside the bar area. pedro and quentin were excellent bellmen, and christopher (concierge) was very helpful. as we left, we shook victor's hand (he's always there!) and told him we've found our new chicago hotel!
truthful	just returned from a one night stay at the knickerbocker, and i will not return. it came nowhere near being worth the price i paid. hotel burnham is twice the hotel at half the price! the bathroom was unbelieveably small and smelled terribly. we had to call the front desk twice before towels that we requested were delivered (which frankly may as well have been paper towels, nothing plush about them at all). we didn't have enough pillows and when we requested an extra it was never delivered. room service cart was left outside our door all night. all in all, it was a very disappointing stay. the only redeeming quality of this hotel seems to be its location. and for me, it's just not worth it.
deceptive	i was completely unfamiliar with chicago but needed a place to stay while my husband worked there for a few days and we picked the sheraton chicago hotel and towers based solely on their internet site. wow did i get lucky! this is a beautiful hotel with all of amenities i could have hoped for, terrific food, and within walking distance of several interesting places, including the art institute of chicago. ashley, at the concierge desk, was particularly helpful at guiding a chicago newbie to the best places to eat ands to see. i will heartily recommend the sheraton chicago hotel and towers.
deceptive	my wife and i booked a deluxe accessible room at this beautiful hotel for three nights. the wonderful photos don't do the hotel justice. it couldn't have been a more ideal stay. the room was spacious and and clean, the bathroom sparkling, with every amenity one could imagine. the bed felt like it had been just delivered. our views of downtown chicago were spectacular. on top of all of this, the hotel staff was extremely helpful. they explained the best routes to the restaurants we wanted to eat at, and they even went as far as securing us reservations for the places they knew would be busy! believe everything good that you read. if you visit chicago, stay at the conrad chicago.
deceptive	when my husband and i went to amalfi hotel we were expecting first class service. first, when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked. room service took forever and the food was subpar. supposedly they had planners to help explore the area, but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner. the spa staff seemed incompetent. the only positive things i can say about amalfi hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised. i give this hotel two stars.
truthful	i believe i can not describe how amazing was our stay at the james. service was impecable, from the door man to the front desk. location could not be better. yes, you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor, but, come on, you are downtown, what do you expect....overall noise was not in a level to bother us. the only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm...pm not am? go figure...
truthful	we brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. small rooms, but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. lots of interesting amenities in the room. convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. watch out: the concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre, large restaurants where they get kickbacks. we have stayed here several times and i always check for rooms here when i travel to chicago. however, the hotel is often full so book early.
truthful	the hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy. the entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding, making it dark. they charge a lot for internet hook up, wifi is not included. the staff was very slow, i am assuming they were all new. they could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby. the room was set up weird, the bathroom opened facing the bed, rather than the hall as most do. room temp was hard to control, even though they had a digital thermostat. overall i was very disappointed, had i been staying more than one night i would have switched hotels.
truthful	stayed here for two days while attending lollopalooza music festival. one of the best locations in chicago, on michigan ave near the tribune and sun-times buildings. an easy walk or bus ride to many attractions. the king sized room was very nice, not large, but with a generous bathroom. service was excellent throughout. check out the awesome swimming pool, straight out of twenties.
deceptive	this hotel is overpriced. one should pay money for luxury, but they fall far short considering the prices that they charge. when you go to the hotel restaurants you expect a certain mark-up because, yes, they do have to make money. but the prices they charge for food that was okay makes little sense to me. when i got there and went to my room, i thought that there would be nice colors, a great view, and deluxe bedding. what i got were sheets that might have come from the full price section of target--they were not cheap, but not that expensive either. i think i could have found something of this quality at less than the 200ish a night i paid.
truthful	"we got a spanking deal at this hotel for $99 a night. it's in a good location to the loop. excellent transportation options abound. my gripe comes from the fact that we were obviously put in a ""crappy"" room. it overlooked the back of the building and the roof of a building next to us. the toilet in the room was not bolted to the floor. other than that, if i needed to stay in the loop again for something and i knew i wasn't going to be put in a undesirable room, i would stay here again."
truthful	i found this wonderful hotel ! the location is awesome, just minutes away from all the shopping, restaurants and bars you could possibly want . i was in town for an interview, so i was really nervous . i ended up suggesting the hotel restaurant for my interview and they took such a good care of us, they made me feel so comfortable that i was hardly nervous at all. and the place was pack! the room was superb! really cool design . i had a room they call an apartment, and it was fantastic! the natural light you get in this room is awesome, and i am very sensitive to dark places. they have a full bar in the room , which i was able to use to entertain my friends that night. i went to the gym for a little bit of exercise and i have to say i have never seen such a extensive facility in a hotel. all the staff made me feel like i was family. they were available to me at any time, and so friendly ! i will definitely be back for another stay.
deceptive	the hotel allegro in chicago is understated luxury. i love the minimalist decor, and the linens were quality and exquisite. you can't beat the location, either, it's located in the heart of the theatre district. walking distance to all the great restaurants in chicago! they also offer an in-room spa service, which is pure decadence. i chose to indulge in the eucalyptus mani/pedi. it was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure i have had in my life (135 dollars) but it was a wonderful experience. the eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time. i highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer.
truthful	don't stay here if you take peace in knowing you have a reservation. about 3 months ago, we booked a room here for our wedding night (which is in less than 2 weeks). my fiance called last week to confirm the room and everything was great until today when they called to bump us to another hotel - no upgrades, no discounts. apparently it is my problem that their manager can't manage the convention schedule. i don't even want to stay at another kimpton hotel because i don't find their reservation system reliable. unfortunately, due to the conference, there isn't any other place to stay.
deceptive	me and my business associate had a job in chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features. we did some research online and came across the hotel moncaco. we decided to stay for 3 nights. when we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights. the staff was upstiff, and didn't not offer much hospitality. our room did have a view, but of the city lights and kept our room bright, even with the curtains closed. the beds appeared soft, but did not offer much comfort. for what we paid, we expected more.
truthful	this was a great place to be! great views of river and lake, walk to everything, a clean and comfortable room, and very accommodating staff. we arrived early and were checked in by 10:30 am and checked out late , effectively adding two days to our vacation. it is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers.
truthful	we stayed for just one night ,but the hotel staff was extremely friendly and polite. the rooms were clean and large. the decor had just been redone. the best perks were the complimentary continental breakfast on each floor in the morning and the free cocktail hour with premium drinks and great appetizers at night. we got a great rate and would go back. great location for walking around.
deceptive	the talbott hotel is a place to stay where the staff treat you like you are not welcome. if you do not pay higher prices you are snubbed and the rooms are no classier or fancier than a standard motel. the room service takes over an hour and there is constant traffic and construction outside. the cost is far more than the luxury. the best thing about staying at this hotel are the bathroom towels.
truthful	over-hyped and over-priced. the fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at 5 doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a 4 star hotel. the hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadn't been cleaned...well, ever. the decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed. the decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again. the bed was the most uncomfortable thing i have every tried to sleep on. i couldnt sleep the whole week that i stayed there. it was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny. my final say is that it is an over priced holiday inn.....
deceptive	although much too overpriced in my opinion, the hotel is spotless. the staff was very courteous. and the spa service ? was a god send ! in a relatively flexible location for traveling for sight seeing so i didnt spend major bucks trying to get around the city ! love it ! going back for my anniversary
truthful	stayed in april for two nights. i hesitated selecting the sheraton becaue i had a very poor stay there earlier this year. as far as i'm concerned, that's two strikes and i won't give them a chance at # three. doormen wouldn't help on arrival, huge line at c/i, lousy room, malfunctioning remote, unresponsive staff, and incorrect bill. if you want to be close to michigan ave, try the westin or intercontinental and spare yourself the problems. i don't understand why certain places never improve. is it that tough to properly train a staff?
deceptive	i traveled to chicago recently with my giant german shepard dog rex and picked the hard rock hotel for the perfect location and because a close friend had warmly recommended their pet friendliness. the service truly is incredible. they even had a web-cam so i could check in on rex while i was out for dinner in the evening and a friendly staff member took him for a walk when i could not make it home from a meeting the day after. the rooms really rock (pardon the pun). nothing like the cheap plastic laminated stained carpet decor so common in other places that allow pets. the easy chair looked so good that i was almost afraid rex would snack on it while i was out, but he seemed to like the guitar chew-toy that came with the pet package better. i would definitely recommend the hard rock hotel to my friends - whether they travel with or without pets.
deceptive	my husband and i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel chicago and we can't wait to go back! the hotel is located in downtown chicago and seems to be at the heart of the city, we were close to everything. the hard rock hotel is forty stories high and the view from our room was simply breathtaking. the room itself was spotless and featured modern luxurious decor and furnishings. the bed was heavenly. the hotel staff was friendly, upbeat and extremely helpful, we asked for directions and restaurant recommendations and they were spot on with both. i highly recommend the hard rock hotel in chicago and i would stay there again in a heartbeat.
deceptive	this hotel is great! i love its interior design of the room. customer service is excellent! and its gym and spa are gorgeous. if you need to go to chicago, this hotel would be your best choice! you can also check its website for the special offer, i found a great deal on it!
deceptive	"i recently had a horrible stay at the intercontinental hotel in chicago. when i first arrived i was impressed with the architecture and location, but things went downhill in a hurry. the front desk staff was extremely rude upon checking in and even though i had reserved a room with two queen beds, they told me that ""only king bed rooms were available at the time"", and there was nothing they could do about it. the room itself was a nightmare. it smelled like an ashtray and it was very clear that the bedding was in dire need of replacement. there was also a huge problem with my television, in that it would automatically turn itself off every 15 minutes or so. i complained about these problems, but very little was done. the hotel staff eventually did bring me new sheets, but the quality was only marginally improved. overall i was very disappointed with my stay at the intercontinental hotel in chicago. from the pictures i had seen online i had expected a wonderful hotel, but what i actually got was on par with what you would typically find at a rundown interstate motel."
truthful	we were checked into a room with empty beer bottles,dirty shorts in the closet and an unclean bathroom. there was no manager available for an hour to take any complaints. the front desk lady said the manager was on a lunch break at 7 pm!!!!!!! we missed our show at navy pier because of the extra time it took in moving into another room etc. finally when i got to talk to the manager and complained about beer bottles she offered to send me wine and cheese to make up for the inconvenience!!! this was totally inappropiate since i had children including a teenager with me. she gave me a $30 compensation for ruining our family holiday!!!! staff was somewhat reluctant to take request of extra blankets at night. they kept telling me to look into the closet for extra blankets. i asked for two blanket, but they delivered one. i had to keep calling to get settled for the night. i saw a filled out comment form from the prior guest in our room on the study desk, who had taken the trouble of filling it out, but no one collected it or cared for it. noisy rooms. can hear the doors open and close all night. the breakfast items kept running out and had to make calls to get them replenished. i will not recommend this hotel to any one even at discounted rates!!
truthful	the omni was chosen for it's location whichworked out perfectly. the bedding was wondeful and everything seemed fairly clean ...until...i sat down in the tub...there was black mold in the soap holder, in the cracks on the walls between the tile, all under the tile overhang above the tub and completely around the toilet bowl. needless to say i drained the tub and took a shower...i really don't care for showers. oh yes...the toilet leaked as well...the staff were very helpful but i was disappointed. i travel extensively and don't think i will return. we needed color copies for a business meeting and their printer was broken, so the man in the business center took the jump drive to another part of the hotel, printed the presentation and delivered it to our room. they try! we booked online for a weekend package and got a room on the 10th floor with a view of the windows of another building...but we weren't there too much.
deceptive	while the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside, my experience went downhill once i walked in. the lighting is very poor, which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere. the mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay. i definitely would not stay here again.
deceptive	conrad chicago it was 5:00 am my plan just flew in and i was tired i checked myself into the confad chicago when i first got there there was a creepy employe the floor was filthy but i got my room in the 5th level of then as i dashed towards the elevator my suite case in hand i entered it then that's where i started to see the beauti of the place the walls where polished wood there was even a small ac/heater unit and it was good. then out of no where ting i made it up there this place was great the carpets where velveteen it was a true luxurious hotel i found my rooms and was greeted to a golden door nob i was living in paradise after i got into my room it was a perfect! the room was a perfect 68 degrees. i was shocked to find how confrotable the bed was... perfect! and it had leather pillows and a huge blanket then just when i didn't think it could get any better i look my bathroom its perfect stone and gold! the water actually has a good taste to it like grapes i was so shocked i fell uncontentious i was drowning cause my face fell into the toilet then i woke up you wont believe how fast the assistance will save your life there! i when t back up into my floor and guess what i say out the windows a swimming pool and it was huge olympic sized swimming pool it was great. i got on my beach suit and went down there and it was heated over all i don't think i can leave and all of the other swimmers where pretty nice rich people and they where alright though a little big stuck up but not too much. then came dinner time perfect. i must say i am extremely satisfied with my visit! time to fly back to where i cam from and then my plan took off i'm going to miss that hotel 10/10!
deceptive	i would like to add a comment, maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination. my daughter was married in may of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the sofitel water tower; we were amazed. she always wanted a ballroom type of wedding, and sofitel made this happen for her. they took care of all the invitations, cake decor, and so much more. the special day for my daughter was worth everything. if you are going to be in the chicago area, check them out; you will not regret it!
deceptive	the hotel was very nice; service was great, everyone was very friendly. the room was very elegant and classy. the bed was so comfortable. the room also had a flat screen tv and bose sound system. not bad. overall i had a great experience; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room, i left here well rested and happy.
deceptive	after considering several hotels in the area, my family and i finally decided, unfortunately, on homewood suites, for our long weekend vacation. overall, the experience left much to be desired. the breakfast buffet consisted of cold scrambled eggs and greasy pastries. the linens on one of our beds seemed dirty, and when i told the hotel staff and asked them to be replaced, the woman rolled her eyes and had a very unprofessional attitude. i would not come back here ever.
deceptive	"upon arriving to the hard rock hotel in chicago, i was immediately impressed. the staff was friendly and checked us in quickly, which is important to me after a long trip. our room was immaculate and decorated in a clean modern style. the bed was very comfortable, including the linens which felt high quality, unlike what you get at some other hotels. all this made for a great night sleep. perhaps the most impressive part of our stay at the hard rock hotel was their ""party like a rottweiler"" package we added to our reservation. for an additional fee we were able to bring our pet and were provided with treats, toys and best of all the pet cam! we left our dog in the room with a pet cam and were able to watch him throughout the day on my iphone! all in all this was a great place to stay and i'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to travel with their pet."
truthful	"great bed, but when i first came in, i requested a room with a lake view (i requested this over the phone as well), and the front desk woman said ""this is a great room"". i go upstairs and its awful looking. the view was of the neighboring roofs. then i spent half an hour trying to find a better room. eventually i got a corner roof with a partial view. horrible experience. also rooms were small and had crappy look (yellowy wallpaper and bedsheets)"
deceptive	a perfect place for couples to get away too. the location couldn't be better,just three blocks from navy pier and magnificent mile. it's really romantic, the service was awesome. very clean and quiet. it has big rooms with comfortable atmosphere, huge bathroom.over all, i had the a great experience there, would definitely stay there again!
truthful	i am writing in regards to our stay april 22-24. we were celebrating our honeymoon and were disappointed with our stay. there was construction going on in the hotel and we were not notified of it prior to our stay. my husband had ordered champagne and strawberries for the room to be in there prior to our arrival...it wasn't. when he called to place the order again, it never showed up. we were so disappointed and surprised by the lack of service that we decided to forgo ordering them for a 3rd time. our room was very small, drab and lacked the romantic setting we were looking for. we had called to request a room with a large tub, similar to the ones in the photos, prior to our arrival, noting that we didn't mind an upgrade cost. instead, the tub was incredibly small. we have stayed at the intercontinental in other cities before and had such high expectations for the chicago location, especially considering we were celebrating such a happy, once-in-a-lifetime occasion. the service and amenities just didn't match up.
truthful	stayed here in november 2011 on a leisure trip to chicago. hotel is very dated, with some rooms that just aren't good enough. front desk staff was rude. will not be staying here again - prefer the swissotel and the hyatt properties (regency is similarly priced, and park hyatt is 3x more) and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well (kimpton, etc). pros: -the only hotel that opens onto michigan avenue, very close to all of the excitement -eno wine bar has a great selection of cheeses -rooms are clean cons: -some hotel rooms just make no sense - our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge (effectively no view), and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall (actually no view) -you have to pay for everything - internet, gym, and the pool (which was not available due to renovation...) -entire hotel was very old, not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one -front desk staff was rude
truthful	have stayed at this hotel on several occasions and have never failed to be anything but delighted. great bar (draught stella and guinness) which was being upgraded at the end of march when i was last there, good food, lovely staff, large clean rooms, comfortable beds, spot on location for the golden mile, joey's pizzas next door are fantastic. ignore any bad reviews you read about this hotel as the authors must either have been very unlucky or impossible to please. highly recommended
truthful	"just returned from the james hotel after staying at the park hyatt. i have stayed at most chicago hotels: pennisula, four seasons, the ritz, fairmont etc. had heard a little about the james and the primehouse at the james. we paid more for the room at the james then at any of the above mentioned hotels. what a disappoitment! the room we stayed in had 2 double beds. the toilet broke and overflowed, the tub didnt drain while showering and the huge bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times. the closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all. the room was very small and non descript. much like staying at an ikea but without the color. windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small. the staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly. the room had a huge 52"" plasma tv that was nice. there is no way this hotel is 4 star yet. the room rate close to $500.00 a night was way of of line. we paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels. the rate should have been about half of that."
truthful	i stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and love it! the staff are great, the rooms are spacious and clean, and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on michigan ave. plus if you sign up for omni select membership (for free) you get free wireless internet access.
truthful	"stayed at the amalfi hotel in chicago this month with good expectations. and what a disappointment! paid just under $200 for a ""deluxe king"", and what we got was a 2nd floor view of construction, a dirty, badly ""rehabbed"" bathroom, itchy sheets, no down comforter!! (just sheets and the gross old hotel blanket thing) , previously opened bottles in our mini bar, and plenty of rude, inexperienced staff members & managers (def. not a 3 or 4 star staffing!!) i do live in chicago, and have stayed at a wide range of places. i know that for $200 in february, you can expect a great hotel. as there were many available the weekend we stayed at amalfi, choosing it over say, the palmer house hilton, hotel sax, sutton place, hotel 71, was a huge waste. definitely keep looking and book elsewhere. not worth the price at all, don't let their pictures fool you. also, i wouldn't say that our experience was just a rare mishap, the hotel looks like an old days inn that had undergone a slight renvation, i.e., new lamps."
deceptive	i recently stayed at the talbott hotel for 3 nights and i could not have been more disappointed. it was a terrible experience. long wait to check into room since room wasn't ready even though i arrived way after the check in time. front desk was very rude. was given a smoking room when i had requested non-smoking. room service left a lot to be desired. the food took forever to arrive and when it did it was cold and unappetizing. the staff at the hotel was not very helpful and was very unfriendly. had no toilet paper in room. room was very noisy. could hear people next door opening doors, watching tv, talking. the room was very dingy, small and had a musty odor. needless to say i will not be staying here again nor will i be recommending this hotel to anyone else. stay away from this hotel. not worth the money.
truthful	we travel to chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the hilton chicago. we booked a priceline room on the weekend of the half marathon. the place was busy, but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest. the room was nice and just what we expected. the pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel. the location was great as we were taking in the bears 49ers game on a thursday night and a sox game on a friiday night. we would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others. great quality even at the regular room price.
truthful	i asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what i got. the room was pleasantly decorated, functional and very clean. i didn't need a whole lot of service but when i did they were pleasant and prompt. i used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order. it is in a great location at one end of the michigan avenue shopping district.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the omni after attending a wedding that took place there. we were delighted at the luxury of the rooms and the accomodations were wonderful. everyone from the concierge to the housekeepers were friendly and professional. we were extremely pleased with the whole experience and look forward to our next trip to chicago so we can stay there again. and, by the way, the wedding was absolutely gorgeous!
truthful	my wife and i frequently stay downtown for a night in the city. we have been to many hotels in the downtown chicago area. my opinion of the swissotel - spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience. the swissotel has a very 'cold' atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable. the room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average. the view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel. other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more. our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at 8:00a which woke us up. we called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk. we also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel. they said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register. he didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment. overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment. spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off michigan avenue for real top notch service. anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area.
deceptive	the conrad chicago hotel had some of the worst service i have ever dealt with. i got the executive room with a king size bed. when i got in, the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud. i called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me. they have a pillow menu which i tried to select from but they were out of over half of them. the ipod dock was not working either. also, the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm. this hotel is the worst in chicago and i would never recommend going there!
deceptive	i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a fun weekend in chicago. the standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable. i love a hotel with all white sheets because then i know it's clean. i really liked the simple and modern decor, especially the huge upholstered headboard. nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter. the bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home. the staff was friendly. can't really judge the service because i didn't have any problems or complaints. so i didn't have a reason to interact with the staff much. overall, it was a very nice hotel in a great location. will definitely stay here again on my next visit.
truthful	we have just returned from 4 nights at the conrad chicago, everthing about the hotel was excellent. wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class. great view from our room. the hotels location is great, right in the centre of the magnificent mile. a wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the conrad.
truthful	"the room i booked a room here and was told i'd be getting a king bed. when i check in, they say they only have a queen bed room available. i protested to no avail. when i got to the room, it was really only a full size bed. so i went from from a king bed at home to a full size bed in a tiny broom closet of a room in chicago. for the pleasure, i paid the same price as a normal king bed room. the full size bed we had was also extremely uncomfortable. i think it was lop sided because they never rotate the mattresses. we would wake up with body aches and headaches. my wife even said she lost feeling in her arms some nights. not good. also, the internet in the room is hard to set-up, slow to use, and inconsistent. i generally had to restart my computer at least once to get the internet to work. the internet worked one day on my iphone and then would not log me in. it's not really worth it. room service room service was very inconsistent and nonsensical. some mornings they would take our towels (even the ones we hung up to use again) and not replace them, other times they would replace some towels and not others. they would also come at vastly different times. hotel service this hotel loves to nickel and dime. i asked for a fridge in the room and they told me it'd be $25. no other hotel i've ever stayed in (regardless of how many stars it had) has ever charged me for a fridge in the room. late checkout? charge. shuttle from the airport? - nonexistent. the front deck ""gold passport"" people can't even figure out how to get you points. in the end i will have to call corporate and get my points for my stay (not that i plan on staying at a hyatt property again). by the way, apparently the hotel is still undergoing changes because my mini-bar was missing. i was thinking of using it as a fridge instead of paying $25. the hotel the hotel has some cool bars and a beautiful lobby area in the east tower. the west tower has some underground amenities no one uses. the bars are extremely expensive, but the drinks are tasty. the food is edible too, but i wouldn't brag about it. the hotel is not directly on the main street (michigan), but it's not too far from it. it's right next to the boat tours and, in some rooms, has a view of the navy pier. our room faced another hotel, but we could see a sliver of the pier. the hotel is walking distance from millennium park. it's a bit of a walk to any of the l stations though. if you want a wonderful breakfast place, go to wildberry on randolph st. it'll have you waiting to eat for a long time, but it's yummy! conclusion i get better rooms, better beds, better service, and better amenities at a holiday inn express or a best western. save the money and stay elsewhere."
deceptive	"we originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website, read about their ""romantic weekend getaway."" having never been in the area before or stayed at an ambassador hotel we really didn't know what to expect, but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be. upon arriving, the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car, unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic. it only went downhill from there. the bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldn't figure out what it was. we ended up getting a different room, which was very mediocre. needless to say, we won't be staying here again."
truthful	my girlfriends and i stayed 4 nights at the talbott returning home on saturday 9/29. we all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel. the staff from top to bottom were excellent, accommodating. the room was roomy...with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town. the construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk, but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty. the doorman, andrew was an excellent source at this hotel. he arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants. we enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city. the hotel was expensive but met expectations.
deceptive	if you are looking for a true luxury experience, hotel monaco chicago is not the place to go. i stayed here while visiting friends and decided to treat myself to a luxury experience. i did not get it. check in was not a pleasant experience. the wait was long and the front desk staff were unfriendly and unhelpful. the room was ok, no roaches or anything, but it was small and cramped. and the mirrored headboard on my bed was more tacky motel than fancy hotel. the house cleaning service was really pushy and tried to clean my room at 8:30a in the morning. when i asked them to come back later, they gave me a whole 15 minutes before they came back. and getting extra towels was like pulling teeth. i don't know if they thought i was going to steal them or what. the room service food that i ordered was fine, but it took forever to be delivered and was half-cold by the time i received it. when i called the front desk to complain, they apologized, but did not offer to compensate me or send me new food. they have a restaurant at the hotel, but i did not bother to try it. the prices were ridiculous, the menu was limited, and my room service experience assured me it was not worth the hassel. i was really disenchanted with this experience. at $400 plus dollars a night, i received mediocre accomedations and poor service. spend your hard-earned money somewhere else.
truthful	"i have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood, cost and amenities. the hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open, you wouldn't know it. you need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock. the beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a ""nicer historic hotel."" i will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime. it was a very frustrating experience."
truthful	"we have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds. we were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch. our room was small but adequate. location was great, close to the l trains and also close to the train station as we always ""walk"" from union station."
truthful	spent three nights at the hotel for a girls weekend. the staff was wonderful, room was beautiful and location great. you can take the train directly from midway and walk one block to the hotel. very close to museums and restaurants. i have stayed here before and it always proves to be a great choice for a trip to chicago.
truthful	i stay in chicago all the time on business and had my first stay at the chicago hilton. i pretty much only stay at hilton properties and have stayed at tons from hawaii all the way to budapest. this hilton is not up to par. it's clean and the front desk staff is nice, but in chicago, the drake, doubletree guest suites, and even the hilton garden inn are all superior to the chicago hilton (and less expensive). compared to other hilton properties in chicago, the rooms were not as well appointed, the bathrooms in the rooms were smaller and not as nice, the tv was tiny, the hallways on the executive floor were very noisy all night long, and the breakfast you get was more like a hampton inn than a 4 star hotel. if you're going to chicago and you like hilton brand hotels, you can do far better than this place.
deceptive	i was going on a 3 day personal trip to chicago, and i decided to indulge myself a bit this time around. i chose to stay at the talbot, an upscale hotel in the heart of downtown chicago. to start off, i was not pleased. for the hundreds i pay a day, i expected an impeccable hotel. first, the check-in process was bad as somehow it took them nearly 15 minutes to find a reservation i had placed nearly a month in advance. some customer service they claim. next, when i went to my room, i found that room service had not cleaned it at all. i was forced to wait as they called up a maid to entirely reclean the room as it was strewn with used towels and such. in summary: yes, it was a fancy hotel, yes it had nice accommodations, but the service i experienced there was simply not up to par with a hotel of that price.
deceptive	"the hilton family would be outraged after hearing about a recent stay (i.e. nightmare) at the palmer house hilton. i arrived 3 days before the national restaurant association tade show hoping to beat the crowds and settle in for a long week of trade show business. when i arrived i was greeted or really snarled at by the clerk. this lady (if one can really call this beast that) was aggressive and rude from the get go. she made a snide comment on the number of bags i had and it was downhill from there. my guaranteed and confirmed reservation had been mysteriously cancelled and she indicated that i had been the one to contact their call center seeking a cancellation. i informed ""brenda"" that i had never cancelled my reservation. we had originally booked 2 rooms (one for me and one for colleague) and my colleague changed their reservation to come in one day later. she huffed and puffed and finally said, oh okay, i read it wrong but we don't have a room for you. my room had been given away to someone else that had arrived earlier that day. as a hilton honors member and someone that drops lots of money on this chain, i was furious. she said that perhaps someone else had found me a room at another hotel and to wait while she checked. she left the front desk and was gone for almost 20 minutes, coming back with a smirk on her face. she informed me that i had to make a decision and that both would not be satisfactory 100%. the first option was to stay at a hotel outside of the chicago downtown, closer to the airport or that i could go with another room they had, a smaller smoking one with the potential but promise of an upgrade in 3 or 4 days. i was outraged. no, i'm sorry and certainly the options were horrible. i ended up taking the smoking room where i barely spent any time in it due to the strong cigarette smells. additionally, there was no upgrade at all during my stay there. i was not offered anything to make up for my troubles, their screw-up nor did the hotel manager bother to return my call. the net outcome: i will never stay at this hotel again and i'm thinking of shredding my hilton honors card. don't make the mistake of dealing with this property. you will be very, very sorry. thanks for reading all this. hopefully it will help someone out there before booking at this joke of a hotel."
truthful	"i gave the conrad a second try at impressing me and it failed miserably. the hotel will not honor room requests. i expressed this was for a special occasion and would love a room with a view on my reservation. i got there and my 'view' was of the adjacent office building windows. i didn't pay nearly $400 a night for that. i called down and the manager was absolutely rude. ""that would've required you to pay at least $40 more.."" rude. lots and lots of mistakes happened. requested pillows were never sent up, the television sound was not functioning (i.e. no sound), when telling the manager of the problems he was horribly condescending and cared very little. i've had better service at a hampon inn! when they screwed up our breakfast vouchers i had to physically go down and question it.. they said ""we will send them right up"".. no, that never happened. absolutely ridiculous. the bathroom has always been nice, and the room had been renovated since i was there last year (thank the lord!)... it had a nice ambiance to it. the bed was quite nice as well. the valet guys were fantastic, probably the nicest men within that entire hotel. also the bellman, and housekeepers were wonderfully sweet and always said ""hi"" or ""hope you have a wonderful day"".. i appreciated that. perhaps the management team needs to go back to training school to learn about customer service. breakfast at the conrad restaurant is to be avoided completely. the service was abysmally inept, and not to mention slow. we had two different watresses and it took upward of 15 minutes just to get our juice. they looked like they hated their jobs, and treated us with the same attitude. we were never checked on after the food came. the food is overpriced and the quality is severely lacking. i got a continental breakfast and it included a muffin (burnt), a small croissant, and a tiny cinnamon roll. 14 dollars for that. laughable. or if you choose, for 14 dollars you can get some toast and juice! spare yourself and choose to eat elsewhere where you can get an actual tasty meal for your money. overall, the managers need to learn what customer service means, and how to bend over backwards for a customer. otherwise your business will crumble. and the conrad has crumbled for me. i spent way too much money on terrible service. i've already sent my opinions to hilton headquarters. i'll be looking at other hotels the next time im in chicago."
truthful	stayed in a junior suite which was beautiful and spacious. it had the largest flat screen tv i have ever seen in a hotel (great excuse to catch up on some movies) the breakfast buffet was great and was served in the hotels huge atrium which was nice. the service was top notch. stayed in a lower floor in the east tower which was great as there was no waits for an elevator and they were always empty. the shed aquarium was a complete waste of time and money but the field musium was amazing. chicago remains tied with london as my favourite city.
deceptive	amalfi hotel in chicago is one of the worst hotels i've ever stayed at. i travel a lot for my job, and it just so happened that this was the hotel the company was paying for. four star hotel? yeah right! i wish i could give it negative stars i don't even know where to begin. normally with these reviews i try to outline the aspects that stood out, but it's just so overwhelmingly bad. anyhow, here it goes: to begin with, the customer service stank. you think you've seen rude service people before? well, this is customer service stuff of nightmares. i had a reservation, but i still had to wait for 30 minutes (yes, i counted) for someone just to pay attention to me. when she did, finally, she was chewing gum. no visible uniform or name tag. clearly didn't want to be here. she took one glance at my reservation, didn't enter anything into the computer at all, and told me that they couldn't accept it, because the date had already passed. what? the date for the reservation i had written down was *that day.* i was furious. after a 20 minute shouting match, and an equally incompetent manager that left me so angry i could scream, they finally, grudgingly accepted my name and reservation into the computer, so that i could book my room. then, there was the room itself. on first glance, it appeared clean, but a closer inspection revealed: black mold on the bathroom ceiling, a sink tap that gushed rusty-looking *brown* water, a minibar which was picked at, the remnants looking like they had been there for several years, and a mattress with a mysteriously disgusting yellow stain on it. the pillowcases also looked yellowed, but i couldn't decide if i was beginning to see things, i was already so upset with the place. after an extremely sleepless night of paper walls and neighbors who were, apparently, elephants, i can easily say that i would never go back to that hotel again. ever. not if somebody payed me.
truthful	"swisses chicago: nice, but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the chicago waterfront. a spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city, but don't plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning. no free wifi here ,or affordable breakfast, or a free swim in the pool. just a ten-dollar-a-night charge for internet, an on average $25 plate for breakfast, and another 15 bucks a night for the ""fitness center."" i've stayed in small town no star motels where wifi is free as part of a 50 dollar room. get with it - this is 2009! no free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don't need it anyway, but for those of us who aren't charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated. coffee, milk, oj; stale donuts, ,muffins, maybe some cereal. throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby. with regards to swimming, this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till 10 pm plan accordingly. this all makes the $6 fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain. summation: drop the fees, the nickel dimming of folks, and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel."
truthful	great hotel in a wonderful location. i stayed in this hotel last weekend for one night before coming home and i loved it. i couldn't recommend it highly enough. evidently popular and busy, the staff were still helpful. the rooms were lovely and spacious and clean. bathrooms were clean, bright and spacious also. i'd definitely recommend this hotel too, it's close to the magnificant mile.
truthful	"i stayed at the chicago hilton because it was host to a conference i was attending. before i arrived i tried to find out about the ""in room fitness"" program advertised on the corporate website. i called the 800 reservation number and the client service representative answered that the hotel did have a fitness center. i explained that i was inquiring about the 'in room fitness' advertised on their website. she put me on hold and came back a few minutes later and told me that there was no such thing and that i should call the property directly. i did and got the same response. i asked if they could reserve a treadmill for my room. again, this was a problem. when i arrived at the hotel, no treadmill was available. when i went to tour the fitness room the first night i found that they close at 9pm. when i returned to the center the next day i discovered that they charge $13 per day to use the fitness equipment. the pool, track and locker room are free, but to use the treadmills, etc. you have to pay $13 per day. this charge is not noted anywhere -- not on the website, not in any of the guest service materials in the room. the food for the conference was mediocre, but the one room service meal i had was pretty good. during one of the conference lunch sessions the wait staff made so much noise we couldn't hear the speaker. the hvac didn't work well in my room and i kept the windows open for most of my three night stay. the beds were comfortable with very nice linens. i tried to get a late checkout, which was offered on a card in my room. the woman who answered the phone would only give me an hour, not the 11-2pm range advertised in my room. the best service i received was from the folks in the security office. the hotel does not have safes in guest rooms, so i became very friendly with security office as i locked up my laptop between conference sessions and every other time i couldn't carry it out of the hotel. i visit chicago at least once a year for personal travel and will continue to stay at the marriott properties. only wish i had done so for this visit."
truthful	my husband and i decided to take a trip to chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the conrad, not really knowing it's location. we were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on michigan ave. (it's connect to nordstroms right in the heart of downtown. ) great for shopping. the hotel itself was fabulous. the staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants. i recommend going to joe's that's right across the street from the hotel. everyone was raving about it . . .but we couldn't get a reservation. the room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable. it had a very warm and inviting atmosphere. my husband loved the workout room. i highly recommend the conrad!!
deceptive	the inter continental is a great hotel. the staff was very friendly, and the accomidations were great. the room was clean and ready on time, and the indoor swimming pool was perfect considering chicago's weather. eno was simply amazing. their wine selection is second to none. and the turkey pumpkin curry at zest was to die for.
truthful	"my wife and i just spent the labor day weekend in the city, choosing the hard rock hotel as our pad. we've stayed at the hrh in orlando twice and are blown away by the ambience there. it's not that way here. these may be all ticky tacky things, but they added up to us. first of all, the room. we upgraded our reservation thru the hrh website for a room with ""an incredible view"". well, our 9th floor view was of nothing more than the venting on top of the building next to us. that was all we could see. so there was no view. the room was muggy. we had the air turned down all the way and it never got below 74. we woke up sweaty both days. when we opened the window to get a breeze, the noise from the rooftop next to us was overbearing. the room was small and dark, but it didn't bother us that much. the bed may have been the mosr comfortable bed i ever slept in. and we even joked about stealing the pillows! we had the same issue with the honor bar as a previous poster, but they removed the charges no prob. throughout the entire hotel, i counted a total of 3 pieces of music memorabilia. i thought it was a pretty cheesy attempt to renovate an old hotel, throw a styx guitar on the wall, and slap a hrh emblem on the outside. the hotel itself was very clean and did not look like a renovation. the location is good, right on the south end of the mag mile, but there are 10-15 better hotels in a better location to shopping, quality eats, and navy pier. if you have a car, parking will cost you $38/day, which is prob normal for downtown. the hotel restaurant was a chinese restaurant. the bar was small and trendy, and i guess the kicker to it all was that my wife tried to order a pina colada and they told us they didn't have a blender. whaat???? a hrh without a blender? did they not know that jimmy buffet was in town???? mind blowing! i would never, never, never go back here. like i said, there are many better hotels in much better locations. i will stay at the hrh in orlando or elsewhere again."
deceptive	"the hotel sofitel chicago water tower bills itself as a 4-star luxury hotel, but the luxury is evidently in the eye of the beholder. filled with trite modern art and modular, cheap-looking furniture that looks straight out of the latest ikea catalogue, this 32-floor hunk of glass has to be one of the ugliest hotels i have ever seen. ""urban chic"" design does not equal comfort; the seating and bed furniture are made more for the design floor than for actual use. room service is expensive, slow, and the food you eventually do get is mediocre in quality and flavor. the hotel features two bars: the cafe des architectes bar, and the simply named le bar. cutesy french names and trendy modern outfittings do not a good hotel bar make! excellent service, fair prices, friendly and competent staff are what make a bar great, none of which you will find at either of these bars. cafe des architectes is also a restaurant, offering ""seasonal menus featuring contemporary cuisine with french roots,"" which means small portions and large prices at questionable quality. even the old standby filet mignon did not stand up to its reputation, coming out a little dry hunk of meat rather than a succulent steak. pass this one by, if you're looking for a comfortable, enjoyable stay in downtown chicago. the water tower is dry."
deceptive	i got married in the chicago area this passed weeknd and my guests all stayed at the ambassador east hotel. they had nothing but nice things to say about it! my husbands mother is terribly picky about where she stays and this hotel met her needs. the rooms are decorated so nicely and they don't have that funny hotel smell. the pump room was a fun place for the men to hang and watch sports. if i'm ever in the area again i will be sure to book a room at the ambassador east hotel!
deceptive	when most people think hilton, they think luxury. i know i did. i only wish i'd been half right. upon arriving, i was informed that the incompetent staff had lost my reservation entirely. not a very auspicious start, but they did find me another room. granted, the new room had an oh-so-scenic view of the broadside of an adjacent building. but, fine. i was willing to let this slide. i didn't want to be difficult. in the following days of my stay, it got a little harder to ignore all the minor problems that were making the hilton very undeserving of the term, luxury hotel. noisy neighbors. rude staff. if the state of my bathroom towels was anything to go by upon checkout, i doubt my sheets were changed even once. next time i'll ignore the hype and stay somewhere cheaper. the service couldn't possibly be worse.
deceptive	we stayed in the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago in a standard guest room. the rooms had just been renovated, but the changes did not make much of a difference. the room was so small, it felt like we were sleeping below deck on a boat. the decor was drab and there was nothing special about the room. we were excited about the bathrobe and slippers that came with the room, but we assumed there would be a bathrobe and a pair of slippers for each of us; there was only one bathrobe and one pair of slippers. we called the front desk to ask for a second set and were treated like we were trying to scam the hotel and refused to send them. it would not have mattered if they sent a second set; the bathrobe was so scratchy it gave me a rash and there were stains on the slippers. as hotel guests, we expected to be treated with respect and enjoy the stay we paid for. we were severely disappointed.
deceptive	my friends and i were in chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood. well we came across the hotel allegro and immediately fell in love! everything from the colors, the staff, the architecture, and the pricing were amazing! we couldn't have found a better hotel. the service was impeccable..talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget! my friends and i plan on staying here next year when we return.. i can't wait until then!
truthful	we loved the talbott. the location was fabulous...very close to the shopping. the hotel is smaller, but the rooms are very nice. they are very spacious and are able to be darkened to sleep well. also, the beds are some of the most comfortable i have ever slept in. i might also add that our room at queen beds. the staff is all friendly and puts them themselves out for you. the hotel has a cute outdoor eating area on the sidewalk that has flowers, etc. it looks like a scene out of europe. i would highly recommend the hotel. we were there with our daughters; ages 10 and 13.
deceptive	whenever i decided to stay at fairmont chicago millennium park, the only thing that i had on my mind was the idea of taking that time to relax and enjoy some time with my husband. however, the hotel choice wasn't the best. right in the front desk when we arrived there we had problems with our reservation. the room that we had reserved was occupied and so we had to switch to some other room, which was much smaller than the original one. the hotel did give us a discount, but if i'd paid for the large room was because i wanted the it. a hotel with this name shouldn't put its guests in these kind of situation. i wont be reserving room there again.
truthful	overall i had a very bad experience when hosting a meeting for company, but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the swissotel, i thought we should give them another try. turns out my first impression was correct, this is the least friendly hotel i've ever been in! even the concierge was rude and disagreeable. i could go on and on, but instead i'll just say go somewhere else!
truthful	i used to stay at the homewood suites all the time on business but have not stayed there on business since 2005 - since that time my company has been doing business in the suburbs instead of downtown. during december of 2007 and this year 2008 i did stay there a few days with my family and was greeted as if i never left. there is a lady named connie who works the breakfast shift and she greets everyone and always remembers you from years before. a wonderful lady indeed - my wife even commented to me on the way to chicago if that lady would still be there and would still remember and yes she does! its a great place to stay.
truthful	"upon check in - the lobby was busy! i was tired and not feeling well from a tough road show. the front desk person i checked in with was so fast and so nice that i walked away from the desk smiling... that alone was such a great feeling. every time i had any experience with a hotel staff member, i was so pleased! i have to say - service really is everything to me and i have to give this top marks for that. an added bonus was the location... i just think it is perfect for me. on top of that, i had a meeting down in the loop, but not quite sure how to get there - a person approached me in the lobby, asked if he could help me get to my meeting. i thought he was getting me a taxi - but no - he walked me to his suv and drove me to the meeting, ""just a free service from the hotel"" he stated as we drove... really!!!! so cool! i haven't even talked about the pump room yet - great dinner, very professional service, and no attitude. i will return - just up date the rooms a little bit, thats all... the curtains need some help."
truthful	stayed for 3 nights. booked via hotwire, upgraded to historic tower. got a big room, with a nice view.service was great. valet parking was efficient, but you expect it for 53 doller/night. but the location was the best
truthful	"my wife and i stayed here for a weekend in chicago and had an okay experience. the location contrary to other reviews is not very good for a downtown chicago hotel. everything is at least a fifteen minute walk which in the winter in chicago means a taxi ride. the other thing that you should know about this hotel is that they allow smoking everywhere. i don't necessarily mind people smoking but the lobby, the elevator lobbies and any area that was public had tons of people smoking and ashtrays everywhere. the pool/spa/excercise room was not very impressive either. it is accessible by walking through the business center corridor, wondering if you're going the right way and then coming to a pool that is extremely small. there is also no hot tub and the ""spa"" is a closet with a massage table. the concierge was helpful but the people that answer the ""sheraton promise"" phone told me that there was nothing they could do about ice being out on two floors. the beds were super comfortable. i think that this is probably a nice business hotel with top of the line conference and meeting facilities but for couples or families you can do much better in downtown chicago."
deceptive	recently, i traveled to chicago for a business conference and was lucky enough to stay at the hyatt regency chicago. the whole experience was wonderful! the room was spacious and beautiful, and the bed was so comfortable that i had no problem falling asleep, as i normally do at other hotels. the staff were polite and courteous, and after a delicious breakfast in the restaurant, i went to my conference with a smile on my face.
truthful	"the omni chicago really delivers on all fronts, from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on michigan avenue. while this address in chicago requires a high level of quality, the omni delivers. check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under 3 minutes, the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events, and the rooms are some of the largest you'll find at this price range in chicago. even the ""standard"" room has a separate living area and work desk. the fitness center has free weights, weight machines, and two rows of cardio equipment. i shared the room with 7 others and did not feel cramped in any way! all in all, a great property!"
deceptive	recently staying at the omni chicago hotel, was a waste of money. the rooms are typical standard rooms,(unless you want to pay an unreasonable amount for one of the premier rooms), the service from the staff was nothing to rave about unless, your ideal, idea of service is waiting in the lobby for 40 minutes waiting for anybody to help you carry your heavy luggage up to your room. sorry to say in short i think my money would have been better spent staying at a hojo's.
deceptive	i don't know how this hotel ever got such high ratings from others. this hotel was for me: over priced, fingerprints on the walls, stains in the bathroom, funky loud people in the hallway early in the morning, parking/valet was time consuming, and same thing with the elevator. the back to the 1960's furniture is not for me, and what about the breakfast? better to skip their protein-less stuff they had to offer. oh sure it is a hilton, woopee! you pay for the privilege of sleeping there. saw a couple of bed bugs, but took a shower in the morning, and they seemed to wash away. i won't be back to hilton homewood suites again. i'd rather stay somewhere outside the city to save money. think that i'll be happier as well.
truthful	after leaving some important documents in the room, i called and asked for the lost and found department... seven times over the course of a week. eventually i had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected. finally , a deceivingly friendly operator promised me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes, it never happened. so avoid this place because after they rip you off once they'll keep doing it later. they cannot be trusted at their word
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the omni chicago hotel last weekend and i felt compelled to write a review about this wonderful hotel. i have to say i was very impressed with the cleanliness and the beautiful decor of this hotel. not to mention the friendliest and most helpful staff i have ever encountered. i frequently stay at hotels for business but have never had such a wonderful experience as i did at the omni chicago hotel. from the minute we walked in the beautiful front doors to the time of our check out we were absolutely treated like royalty. this is one hotel that i would definitely rate 5 stars. you can be sure, i will absolutely be back in the future.
truthful	just back from 5 night stay at omni and would thoroughly recommend it. staff bent over backwards to assist in anything, no matter how minute. great location on magnificent mile and lots to do there both for adults and my 10yo daughter. if i had to find a fault it would be the extra charges, taxes etc for room service, bar and restaurant, but where is cheap these days? would definitely recommend it, especially for families.
truthful	i stayed there on october 6, 2012. when i pulled the covers of my bed, there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice, which was either a bed bug or cockroach. i trapped it under a glass (see the attached pictures) and called the front desk. the housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach. absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem, failing to follow through on promises they made to me. setting aside the bug problem, i caution that the windows are quite thin. we could hear a lot of the street noise, which made for a hard night's sleep, not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms. for $400 a night after tax, i strongly encourage you to check for alternatives.
truthful	"i was lucky enough to get a ""4 star"" hotel off of priceline for $70 - i was luckier that i got the knickerbocker! from check in to check out the hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly. the rooms are small but cozy. after reading the reviews from other guests i was somewhat scared of what i would find - they must have stayed at a different hotel. i am a very frequent traveler and felt that the rooms and the hotel met the ""4 star"" rating. yes, the rooms and bathrooms were small, but what historic hotel in a big city isn't? the decor and quality met my expectations. the lobby and bar were very inviting. overall, i would stay here again and again."
truthful	"while overall a decent property, the incident i had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel. i recently stayed at the hotel monaco for five nights, checking out on monday, march 19th. shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet, my partner and i noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn't present upon checking in. we had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay. i called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at park one (their valet company) who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within 48 hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival, and was scraped upon departure from the garage. the garage manager, mike yunan, didn't call back until i had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel, marco scherer. when he finally got back to me, the garage manager stated that he would file an ""incident report"" and claim with his insurance company, travelers, which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn't admit fault or liability, nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage, which could have verified that the damage wasn't present upon check-in, but was at check-out. their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location, contradicting the garage manager. in the end, this kimpton intouch guest got stuck with a $1,000 bill for parking at this kimpton property: an almost $500 paint scrape on top of a $48/per day parking fee, rental car expenses, several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue, and one gigantic headache. in the end, do not trust the valets or staff at this hotel, and take your business elsewhere if at all possible."
deceptive	my husband and i stay at the amalfi every year for our anniversary. we just love it! the service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly. the hotel has very good cuisine options, which are all very tasty! the hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there. the rooms are very comfortable and quiet. perfect for relaxing! will definitely keep coming back!
deceptive	the hyatt regency hotel in chicago was the worst hotel i ever went to! i booked a non-smoking room online, and they went ahead and gave me a room that smoking was allowed. after going in my room, i smelled heavy smoke smell. it was really bad. i called the front desk about the issue, and they said they had nothing like that on record and refused to exchange rooms for me! there was also blood stains on my bed sheets. the carpet was also dirty. i would never book at that hyatt again!
truthful	"it's so frustrating when a hotel posts a deal prominently on its website, claiming said deal is available on certain dates. but, when you call to make a reservation based on that deal, they tell you it's not available. there are rooms available, but not the deal. then they try to condescendingly tell you they can only sell so many rooms at such a deal. i get that. then just say that on the website. ""here's a great deal . . . but only a small number of people will actually get it."" so much for the great reviews about service . . . i couldn't even get past the first phone call without being frustrated and annoyed. bad form, conrad, bad form."
deceptive	this hotel is one superior hotel. the prices are reasonable and the benefits are just fantastic. my husband and i got a package that lets us get a hotel with a view and the view was amazing. waking up to seeing lake michigan was a site not to miss. the rooms were always cleaned when we got back from our shopping at bloomingdales or in other places in chicago, and the customer service was top notch and very friendly.
deceptive	the hilton hotel helped us make the most of our trip to chicago. not only are they centrally located near most of chi towns hot spots, but they also helped coordinate discounted admissions to various other attractions. the hilton is very classy with their accommodations. i will be returning at my earliest convenience, be it for business or pleasure.
deceptive	the amalfi hotel in chicago is a wonderful hotel. i had the opportunity to stay there on business and wished i could have stayed for longer. the staff is so nice and helpful. they really treat you like a vip and are there to help with any questions you might have. the rooms are so beautifully decorated that you wish you could hire their designer to do your home. in my room i had access to my own personal dvd and cd collection. did i say in the room? i didn't even have to leave or order something on the television. it was nice to shower with their aveda products and get into my microfiber robe and slippers that they supplied me. while staying in for the night i was also able to use my laptop in my room since they have wifi throughout the hotel.the bed was very comfortable and everything was so clean! in the morning i was treated to a great complimentary breakfast and ordered a massage. yes...ordered. they came to my room and i didn't even have to leave. very comfy! this hotel was by far the best that i have stayed in and i travel a lot for business so i would know.you always have high expectations when you're staying at hotels and i'm pleased to say that my expectations were far exceeded. i'm recommending this hotel to everyone i know that will be staying in the chicago area. i will definitely be back and make reservations for a longer stay this time because i just didn't want to leave! i would rate this hotel 5 out of 5 stars.
truthful	this is best hotel bargin in chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room. great hotel just redone by kimpton. this is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels. this is a location just off of lasalle and next to the cadillac theater. it has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing italian meal. the wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants. the kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels. you sit in a designer, kind of london circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests. they are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it. the exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well. there are two other kimptons here but for the money the allegro is the best value and location. always consider kimptons as they never disappoint where ever we have used them.
deceptive	at the intercontinental chicago, you pay for more than a room. you pay for an experience. let me elaborate. i was a bit reluctant to pay a premium for location and amenities. like any novice traveller to chicago, i saw the mass glut of cheap accommodations out in the suburbs, and those were originally what i set my sights on. price is a powerful signal, and the sheer discount of those options drew me in. but after doing a bit of research, i realised that distance does have its costs. the price of transit in the chicagoland area isn't free. and it's far from what i'm used to. car use is price prohibitive. (i knew that originally, which is why i wasn't going to drive.) but the sting of using the automobile (parking, congestion, toll roads, etc.) gets shoved off onto taxi fares and auto rental. so, i ultimately had to end up looking for a place well connected with mass transit. but mass transit has its costs too, which meant that staying at a focal point downtown had its advantages. that's what originally drew me to intercontinental. but intercontinental is much more than the right room at the right place. the decor of the rooms and the amenities available to the guest are unsurpassable. i was travelling on international business, so the ease with which i could transact in foreign currency was a draw. (they had a currency exchange right there on the premises.) and the fact that massages, dry cleaning, and event planning were available in-house was a huge plus. my work gets me tied up in knots. it also leaves little time for doing chores. so the ability to grab a massage while my suits were being finished was a relief for me. but, on top of all that, the event planning was what put intercontinental over the top. being able to coordinate a comprehensive tour of chicago while completing my business and managing my personal life was a weight off my shoulders--and something i won't forget. in the end, if you're a newcomer to chicago staying in a time-crunch, the intercontinental is for you. the pricetag of rooming downtown can seem prohibitive, but when you factor in the convenience and savings in marginal costs, it's nothing in the end. and the intercontinental is not only price-competitive with the other downtown options, it also makes staying downtown the convenience and thrill it should be.
deceptive	i stayed in on of the james one bedroom apartments for two weeks while in chicago visiting my daughter. the pre-arrival assistant was incredibly helpful in acquiring some necessities i forgot to pack and left them in my room for me. later in the week i treated myself to an asha massage from their lengthy list of delicious spa services. afterward i smelled wonderful and was the most relaxed i'd been in years. my room was clean and modern, yet warm and comforting with dark wood tones and lush bedding. i'll certainly be staying with them again in the future.
deceptive	i recently stayed in a room at the trendy talbott hotel. it looked nice on the outside so i decided to them a whirl. as soon as i walked in i noticed that there weren't alot of hotel employees. usually, the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand. i was tired and i needed a nice room so as i approached the front desk i noticed something odd. food was sitting out right in front of the front desk. people were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush. crumbs everywhere especially where i was suppose to exchange cash and room keys. let's just say it wasn't professional. the room was average and the bathroom didn't carry the kinds of brands i would have liked to see. no wi-fi connection and i had to walk down the hall for ice. talk about lack of customer service. all in all, the stay was sub-par and nothing special.
truthful	we loved this hotel and would definitely come back. initially we weren't given a goldfish, which was disappointing, but then we left a tip for the housekeeper, and she rewarded us with one. we had fun sipping wine and playing wii in the lobby every afternoon. the staff were quite friendly and helpful, even printing our boarding passes for us. our room was very comfortable, with a cozy little alcove at the window where we read the paper. at first we were worried about noise, since our room was next to the elevator, but we hardly heard it, and didn't notice any street noise either. the hotel is colorfully and tastefully decorated, well-lit, and ideally located.
deceptive	i recently stayed in the talbott hotel in chicago with my family of three. i absolutely loved it and will definitely return! the customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic. they were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay. for the nights we didn't want to go out, we had room service. the food from the hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick. i also loved their commitment to the environment. it is clear to me why they have won so many awards. thank you talbott for a wonderful stay!
deceptive	set up an important meeting for some clients at the hard rock hotel chicago. they were flying to chicago for a special trip to checkout the music scene and to discuss business with my company. naturally, they wanted to stay here. the client really seemed to like their rooms, but felt the paul reed smith room was too cramped for our day-long meeting (330 sq ft.). in a panic, i contacted the hrh staff and they actually had another, bigger, room available. we quickly moved our meeting in the birdland room for the rest of the day and the meeting was a rousing success. (birdland room is 660 sq ft.) we have a new client and so does hrh. this is where the client wants to stay every time they fly in for future business meetings with us.
deceptive	i decided to spend the extra money booking a room at the monaco because of the website's pictures of the beautiful rooms and views. it was a waste of cash, to say the least. although i had requested a room with a view of the city, they must have given me the worst room in the place. maid service skipped over my room on my second day there, and i had to call for towels at least twice before someone finally came to my room. the food was outrageously expensive and not even lukewarm. two-star hotel quality.
truthful	my wife and i had to stay downtown for event that we were attending at the drake hotel. i have stayed at the drake before and while it is nice, it is bit stuffy and a little outdated for the price. we opted to walk across the street and stay at the millenium instead. i know this property has under gone many renovations in past year and i have to say they have done a great job. this place used to be the hotel you would crash in when you came to chicago on a college roadtrip (i did). but that is not the case any more. this property is directly across from the drake hotel and for 1/2 the price you get their great location with a newer (albeit smaller) room and every ammenity you would expect from a 4* hotel. the rooms are tastefully decorated (asian influence w/flat screen tv) and the bed is very comfortable. the bath is small (no tub), but very clean and the shower is great. you are not going to be spending a bunch of time in your room when visting chicago, so the room's size is not a big deal. (it works well with a couple, but a family of four may be a bit cramped.) the service was attentive and friendly and the location can't be beat. i would definitely stay here again, but the next time i would leave the car at home ($49/night parking is a bit steep).
truthful	when making my reservation, i made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer memorial day. the staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate. the suites are very spacious, clean, cozy, and comfortable. upon on arriving staff were friendly, willing to exceed expectations, and serve me with enthusiasm. the hot breakfast was delicious each morning. the beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest. i would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other chicago hotels.
deceptive	"having traveled to chicago on business once before, i was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip. after some research, i decided that the palmer house hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay. and, in a way, it was perfect -- perfectly awful. after reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel's website, i was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary. however, my standard guest room, which the hotel's website describes as ""deluxe,"" was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms i had stayed in at budget chain hotels, not pricier historic hotels, such as this one. the carpeting looked dingy, so i had to wear shoes or slippers any time i walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning -- or the horrendous view of a brick wall that i had from my window. in addition, the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long. everything cost extra, including the gym, the pool and the spa, and the restaurant prices were outrageous. this hotel is overpriced, overrated and definitely subpar. i wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy."
truthful	this hotel was perfect for our girls getaway. the decor is fun & refreshing. loved the roof top bar. every staff member was friendly & always smiling. the location is perfect for michigan ave shopping, the beach, dinner and night life. it was a mile or two from millenium station. the concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our names to the guest list (i'm sure they do it all the time but still a nice gesture).
deceptive	my wife and i recently stayed at this hotel for a fun anniversary weekend away from the kids. upon check in we were pleasantly surprised by the decor, the location to so many downtown attractions and the attentiveness of the staff. as a seasoned traveler for business i consider myself somewhat savvy when it comes to service and accommodations. this hotel certainly delivers on both accounts. my wife and i had not intended on eating in the hotel restaurant, but after reviewing the menu we thought we would give it a try. wow! service was outstanding and the food was amazing. we truly enjoyed our dining experience. all in all i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone i meet.
truthful	nestled just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the fairmont chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to chicago. the staff were friendly and helpful, arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city. there are many attractions withiin easy walking distance (the art institute is a must see and millenium park is a fun visit). the architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby. the rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense. we would definitely stay here again.
deceptive	beautiful hotel in chicago. i visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife. they are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services. i would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago.
deceptive	my experience as fairmont chicago millennium park was horrible. me and my wife were on a road trip from new york and stopped had reservations for fairmont chicago millennium park hotel. we arrived at 12:00 am and they did not have a non-smoking room available for which we booked! my wife was pregnant at the time and the reception staff had no sympathy. my wife couldn't handle the smell of the room so i asked for a refund to go stay somewhere else. they refused and were very rude and unhelpful. we had to stay the night, and the first thing next morning we did was leave and look for a different hotel. i will never stay at this hotel again.
truthful	we just arrived from a 3 nights stay at the sofitel chicago water tower. it was faboulous. fine linen, nice room with bigs windows, bathroom with a shower, flat tv. check for the deals on the sofitel website, we had 3 nights for the price of two !
deceptive	i received the type of room that i had reserved. cleanliness seems to be an issue with the maid staff. the carpet had debris and the bathroom needed attention. room service was adequate but not great. the walls seem to be paper then as i heard one neighbor's tv for most of the night and the other neighbor's late enjoyment.
deceptive	i stayed with my husband at the homewood suites in chicago. we wanted to do something nice for our anniversary and thought that the hilton was a solid name brand and expected to have a pleasant stay. unfortunately this was not the case! the staff was very rude at check-in (which took 20 minutes) and the lobby smelled musky and gross. the room itself was not like other hilton hotels i have stayed at. the carpeting was atrocious and the color of vomit, the room smelled of smoke (even though it's advertised as smoke-free) and there were a few long brown hairs in our bed! i was so grossed out that i had to call down to the rude staff to ask for our linens to be changed and they gave us a huge attitude about it. and don't even get me started on how poorly the shower/bathtub worked..a nice anniversary went totally awry due to how crummy this hotel is. if i could give it 0 stars, i would!
truthful	review's a little late, but... my husband & i first stayed at the amalfi in 8/06 totally based on reviews i read on this website. we were totally wowed!! loved the location, the room, the aveda bath products, but most of all loved the evening reception & breakfast on our floor. i returned to chicago with 3 girlfriends in 9/07 and booked us in a suite at the amalfi. it was great - room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased! will stay next time i'm in chicago too!! p.s. they honor a government rate!!!!
deceptive	i needed a place to stay for a business conference in chicago. while higher priced, the reviews online plus four stars convinced me. granted the hotel itself is beautiful, but looks can be deceiving. the pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey. the restaurant (cafe des architect) had amazing food, so that was a plus, but the service was awful. i had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water! my remote wouldn't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud. the hotel must've been hosting a convention because i could hear music all through the night. the housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently. i called twice for more fresh towels. if i wanted this type of experience, i'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel. same experience, less money!
truthful	this hotel is rather stupid to be frank. it's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that saturday night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. the rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them. i actually like the pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. i had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. it also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. i had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan! it was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. on a good note, the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. that's about the only good thing i can say about this place. i would not go back.
truthful	i decided to book at the amalfi after cancelling a reservation for a different hotel after reading their reviews on ta. i was blown away by the reviews for the amalfi on ta and decided to check it out. i was able to secure a great price on the hotel room and i was not disappointed. i asked to be put in a quiet room because i was having an interview the next day. the room was very quiet and in a great location, but my only complaint was that it was right next to the fitness center and i could hear people running on the treadmill during the day. however, it quieted down at night and i could not hear anything. the rooms were enormous for chicago and i was pleased!!! the hotel provided free breakfast which was good, free internet, and free gym access. the hotel is only a few blocks from the magnificient mile and i walked there everyday to do shopping. i have to say that the doorman is truly a gem and is very friendly. i wish that their front desk staff were as friendly as he was. all in all, i plan to stay at the amalfi anytime i visit chicago in the future.
truthful	"this review has two parts. . .i advise reading both. chapter one: the actual hotel and staff i found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating. the room was nice and clean as well. i have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff. this is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the south to reach the riverfront, or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the north. very easy (one block) walk from the subway (red line). the morning complimentary breakfast is substantial. not just muffins and coffee. you can have a complete breakfast here if you want. and, even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient. i would recommend this hotel if based solely on the physical location, the room, and the staff. chapter two: the nightmare i booked this room through central reservations in july for a mid-september arrival. the rate was quoted to me as $159 per night for four nights. when the confirmation was emailed to me, it was incorrect by over $300. i immediately called the hotel. they said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount. i did receive the corrected confirmation email. . .all done? no. one week later, my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged. i called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve. when i explained the error, i was literally called a liar by the person in reservations, and told ""that's not my problem. i can't help you"". . . and then told that i have to pay the higher amount. excuse me? now, i go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance. after a few left messages, i get the general manager to call me back, and discuss the issue. after taking down all of the names of people i spoke with, he assures me that he will credit the account immediately. i even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc. . . one week later, still no credit. so, i call the general manager again. oh, this might take up to 72 hours to process, i am told. so, please give it another week. another week passes, still no credit. so another call to the manager. i am told now that the credit has been processed, and he even sends me an email confirming our ""agreement"" for the credit, just to appease me. another week passes. still, not seeing that credit that was ""definitely processed"" a week ago. yet another call to the general manager on the day before i am to leave on my trip to chicago. i told him i will be arriving, and at this point, i want to see him personally, and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while i am there. remember, we are now talking six weeks and this is still not resolved. i arrive at the hotel, and to make a long story short, the general manager was never available to see me, nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me. the only person i spoke face to face with, was the assistant general manager. he was completely unconcerned with my situation, and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of ""you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said'"". . . what???? today, my trip is over, and i have flown back home. i still have not received the credit to my account!!! i will absolutely be reporting all of this to hilton corporate customer service, and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point. take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel."
truthful	we always stay at the sheraton chicago hotel & towers when we take our kids to the city. you can't beat the location which is in walking distance of navy pier and michigan ave. the hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous fox & obel, a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast. the hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds. my kids enjoy the pool with it's windows that overlook the chicago river.
truthful	i love this hotel. it is one of the best that i have stayed in. the lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable. the made services was terrific. no matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back. i asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly. that is what i liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly. i was there with my daughter for a girl's weekend from thursday - sunday. everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc. was wonderful. i can't say enough good about this hotel. yes the bathroom was small, but i wasn't moving into the room. i was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway. i will definitely stay there again
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago was not as great an experience as i was expecting it to be. when i first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system. they then tried to make me book a higher paying room. i ended up having to ask for the manager, who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate. i was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite. i was not doted on as i should have been and found that i had long wait times when i placed an order with room service or needed the concierge. for the price i was paying to stay there i would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service.
deceptive	"after a my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i contemplated the the poor quality of my experienc there and felt the need to document it. while the amenities were plush, the service of the staff was lacking. upon check in, my reservation was ""lost"" and it took over 30 minutes for the manager to make arraingments for my stay. there was no offer to upgrade me or comp me in any way. room service did a poor job in cleaning my room and left wet towles in the bath room. a used coffee filter was left in the coffee pot for me to clean out. i am not sure my sheets were changed out. when i checked out, the bell hop dropped my laptop and destroyed my hard drive leaving me to scramble to recover the report i spent days creating. overall my negative experience has left me wondering if they train thier staff on the proper way to attend to their customers. i will be relunctant to stay with them again until i am assured they have focused on trainging their staff better."
truthful	the ambassador east is located in the gold coast neighborhood of chicago. it is just a few blocks from the train station, so it was easy to get anywhere in town. the hotel is a national historic landmark so the lobby is elegant and beautiful. we loved the pump room bar with tons of b & w photos of celebrities. the service was wonderful and everyone was friendly and helpful.
truthful	we booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on priceline, paid $85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown chicago. the location is great. the hotel minimally ok> unsure how it gets a 4* rating. it is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift. staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay. however i would not recommend this hotel. i would rather have paid $100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case. my suggestion do not book priceline for chicago il and ask for 4 * because this is what you are almost sure to get.....not good enough priceline.!! in my opinion.
truthful	i'm sitting in the hotel as i right this review and am not impressed with the room. the hotel is not modern in the least - it feels like you're staying in your grandmother's attic. wallpaper is peeling off the wall, not well lit, very few outlets in the room -- especially convenient ones (none next to the bed or built into lamps), terrible views and loud construction noises woke me up at 7am. even the location is off the beaten path - closest l stop is on the red line -- so not accessible via the loop stops on the blue line from the airport without transferring. health club is not on site either. there are hundreds of other hotels i would stay in over this one.
deceptive	last month, my husband and i stayed at the intercontinental chicago while we were in town for imts. although they were very busy, the service was excellent and very professional. the staff were always smiling and happy to help. intercontinental was conveniently located near michigan avenue, and the best stores and restaurants in town. the view from our room was great! our room was always clean when we arrived home at night, it was decorated nicely, and the beds were extremely comfortable! we ate at the hotel's restaurant zest, and the food was great! it was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while. we will definitely be back!
deceptive	"during a recent business trip to chicago i had the pleasure of staying at the hotel allegro. the lobby gave a good first impression. it was a very clean with a modern designer's feel and the customer service was great. i proceeded to the counter to check-in and within 5 minutes i had the key to my room. i was told to check out the infamous 312 restaurant but i was tired from my flight. i checked into my room. the room was great. a king size bed 37"" flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture. after i unpacked i had to check my email. hooking up to their wi-fi was quick and painless! i had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting. i decided to try the restaurant for breakfast. i had an omelet and fruit. the restaurant was great and the food was perfect. i only wish i had more time to stay and enjoy lunch; nevertheless duty called. the concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and i was off to work. i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago. it's one of the best i've ever stayed at after multiple business trips."
deceptive	"i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in chicago. although i visit this fun city quite often, i was somewhat disappointed with the service and noise in a hotel that is called ""luxury boutique"". to begin with, our ""experience designer"" was somewhat put-offish and cool. she did not really have a grasp of all the wonderful things to do in chicago. although she did look up some attractions, it seems like she may have recently arrived from la. as far as the room, it was indeed luxury and had nice lighting and decoration. however, the noise from the adjoining room was unbelievable and kept us up all night. most likely, the walls are very thin, and construction is not the greatest. who wants to hear the neighbors, especially when they are honeymooners or whatever! so we probably will not stay there again. the location is great, the cocktails fine, the luxury is there, but other than that, it is the pits. weary traveler, san francisco"
deceptive	wow! i have been to many hotels as a business man, and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels. but wow, this hotel was great. the staff was prompt, the room was extremely clean, and everything just ran like a well-oiled machine. i was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things. usually i have to pay 5$ for a stupid toothbrush, but not here! i really enjoyed staying at intercontintental. i was very worried about the chicago area's reputation of bad hotels, but this turned out just great. next time my boss flies me out to chicago, i know where i am staying!
truthful	"what can i say... this used to be our favorite hotel in chicago because of its location, its historic and gorgeous pool, it amazing sunday brunch, it's relatively low price compared to comparable hotels, its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership... all of the above has fallen disappointingly by the wayside with a resounding thud. let's break it down: location: i'll concede that it's still great. get a corner room in the historic tower higher than the 20th floor with a view of michigan ave and/or the river. its historic and gorgeous pool: closed indefinitely! when asked when it will re-open, the hotel staff actually said, ""maybe never."" its amazing sunday brunch: zest is gone, and his been replaced by a very dark michael jordan restaurant that takes up much of the lobby and second entrance. (the lobby, by the way, used to be beautiful and open with lots of places to sit. also no longer...). the food is very bad. very. bad. there are so many restaurants in this city. do yourself a favor and go somewhere else to eat. its relatively low price compared to comparable hotels: based on my review of everything else. go to the drake, or the peninsula. completely worth the extra money... that, or downgrade to the hilton and get what you expect and pay for... the intercontinental has fallen so low that you pay a higher price than the hilton, but you get a worse experience! its exclusive benefits of the ambassador membership: i canceled our membership after this disaster. part of the membership includes early check-in (granted, when available)... but our room wasn't ready until 6pm. this is obviously after normal check-in. the staff was overwhelmed, and not effective or helpful. i tried to speak with the manager about our room, waited in long line to speak with someone, only to be told that my husband needed to be with me because the membership was in his name. in a nutshell. go somewhere else. ps: go to argo tea next door instead of the starbucks in the hotel. way better food and coffee."
truthful	"my husband and i stayed here for new years eve weekend. this is an excellent hotel in an excellent location. hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming. the rooms had the best electronics i've ever seen. loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall. the hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by, so we avoided it too. ate at joe's across the street - excellent seafood. and you can shop til you drop without going outside! nordstroms and four story mall is attached. lots of good ""food on the run"" places in there. loved chicago - loved the conrad. i will go back!"
deceptive	my stay at the james hotel in chicago was fantastic! the hotel was clean, modern and everything i had hoped for. the staff was fabulous and went above and beyond all of our expectations. all of our needs were more than met and i will be recommending this hotel to all of our friends and associates.
truthful	"outmoded and worn furnishings combine with some poor original design choices to produce a drab place to stay. this hotel's five-star rating needs a downgrade! when i visited this hotel 14 years ago, the fairmont was among the classiest brands. no more. my 29th floor room was expansive, but dark -- only one small window and one light was not working. the upholstery was frayed, the bathtub faucet produced only a trickle of water, and the room's door didn't close unless you pulled on it in a certain way. worse, the management has filled the room with price lists and displays of things to sell you, with one set of snacks even in a large tacky plastic case on the dresser. it was like sleeping in an old vending machine, but when i looked for a pen to take a phone message, there was none to be found. other reviewers remarked that this hotel ""needs updating,"" but i think some of the original design choices are also to blame. for instance, someone decided to place a series of heavy doors in strange configurations. i couldn't sit on the toilet without leaving the door to the toilet cubby open -- the space wouldn't accommodate my legs. (i am not unusually tall.) there are so many great hotels in chicago that deserve five stars, that the fairmont shouldn't be able to compete. see my profile for better ideas. niftyc"
truthful	"first let me say, i try not to be too critical, but in some cases the truth is warranted! we checked in and things seemed fine. location was excellent. woke up the first morning, to a slightly rumpled bed covered in ""stains"", i hope-filthy and not 4 star hotel quality. requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door- a gentleman was there to let me know if i wanted it done to take off the privacy sign, i did and no one even came until later in the day. the room was big enough, had no drawers, suposedly remodeled but carpet didn't reach the wall, toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken. the mirrors were great and the water was always hot! the walls were paper thin, i heard every conversation the guests next door had. they were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t.v. through the walls and vents. internet was $13.00, worked for a bit and then not again, i called customer service and spent 25 minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later. the hotel did give us a credit for the charges. at this point, enough was enough, we packed our bags and checked out. the front desk was very helpful- kudos to rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops!!"
deceptive	i have to agree that the intercontinental chicago is a nice hotel from the outside. but it is not a nice place to stay if you are planning to visit chicago. the ambience of the hotel looks bland and they also have the same amenities as other cheaper hotels. you can get an excellent dining experience somewhere for less.
deceptive	i just spent a week at the millennium knickerbocker hotel and it was a very plesant stay. when i first walked into the room it was very clean. the bathroom was a decent size and the decorum was pleasant. room service was very good. the view was amazing and i would recomend staying there.
truthful	not impressed at all. the hotel itself looks really nice, especially in the big foyer area. our room was small, and the bathroom needed some major upgrades. it had the green tile, like at your grandmother's house, all over the walls, and 2 people couldn't fit in it if you tried. we could hear the people beside us in the early morning every morning, so obvioulsy the walls aren't so thick. our room looked directly on to a brick building outside, very close, we couldn't even tell if it was nice outside or not. we are assuming we were not in a renovated room from the looks of it, and i felt yucky the whole time in it. i just wouldn't pay lots of money to stay here, there is nothing exceptional about it at all.
deceptive	o.m.g best hotel ever ! i've stayed at various hotels in the area and the service has been really suckish. evan at one hotel i stayed at they had a molded sandwhich under the bed , how gross and i could of really got sick ! but this hotel was the perfect location right by the beach and by all the clubs . ohh . and the pump room , the best food i've evr had at a hotel . i evan got to take a picture with queen anne ! i will never regret coming to this hotel! i loved this hotel so much me and my bridemaid's stayed here . and it's just walking distance from all the popular food places and clubs . ( all the places to be at least )
truthful	reservation was for a king size bed, instead i was given a double-bed room. check-in person must had a bad hair day, because she was unfriendly. wall st journal or usa today is not complimentary. requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator, but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy. i didn't bother to file a formal complain because i was very tire. i travel often to chicago for business and the first will be the last at intercontinental.
deceptive	"we had the pleasure of enjoying a stay at the affinia chicago hotel. we found it conveniently located on e. superior street, near many local attractions. the rooms were modern chic with a very urban feel. the pillow menu was awesome, my partner and i have such different preferences, the choices made it easier to sleep like we were at home. the hotel room layout was comfortable and spacious with all the right touches to make our stay perfect! i couldn't believe the amenities available to guests. my beagle, betsy enjoyed her stay at the ""jet set pet"" care center. she was pampered as much as i was. it was such a comfort knowing we could bring her along and that we could enjoy our stay without the stress and concern that comes along with traveling and pet ownership! another feature i personally enjoyed was the walking tour kit. it included an ipod shuffle pre-loaded with a workout playlist, a deck of cards; guidebook that included walking tours, and comfort items like a towel and map! i felt like i was the most important guest (surely, everyone felt that way as they checked in to their rooms). highly recommend to anyone who has the opportunity to travel in the area of an affinia hotel!!"
truthful	"we arrived and thought for $350 a night, it would be a decent place. good reviews,etc... we arrived to find that the website pictures were misleading. the hotel lounge was a ""room"", it was really odd and very dark. the first night there i noticed that the blanket on the bed was nasty looking. resembled something you'd find on a street. to top it all off we woke up after night #2 to find that bed bugs had attacked us. my husband and i were both bitten. i was bitten way more than my husband. my legs were covered with bites. i was on ointments and benadryl for over a week. i immediately came home and scalded all our clothes. there was also mold around the tub both inside it and on the floor by it. the bathroom floor was also curling up by the tub. the view in room #607 is of a roof. not good. the stay was very disappointing. the only good thing there is the free breakfast on every floor."
deceptive	i stayed at this hotel for a weekend and i thought it was really nice. the bed was extremely comfortable and the room was very clean. the room also had a beautiful view. it had everything you could possibly need. i almost didn't want to leave the room. it was definitly worth the price. i would go back. the clientel was also very helpful.
deceptive	stays here while on a business trip in chicago. first off the staff were very friendly and helpful. they were knowledgeable about the things in the area when i needed to find something. i had a king bed room - it was very clean and cozy and the view was great. this is definitely a hotel i will stay at again if my work takes me back to chicago.
deceptive	during my recent trip to chicago, i stayed at the ambassador east hotel, which is located in the downtown are. i have to say i was not pleased with my stay there. for one, i had requested that my room have one king sized bed when i called for reservations, however, when i arrived, the hotel lobby clerk said they did not have any king sized beds left and i had to settle with two double sized beds. when i told the clerk that a king sized was promised when i made the reservation, he just shrugged his shoulders. when i got to my room, i found it to be very small. there was supposed to be a small refrigerator in the room. there wasn't, although i did not bother to complain after all it did when they gave me the wrong bed. at night, there seemed to be some sort of convention being held at the hotel. i did not figure what the convention was for, but their attendees liked to stay up until the early morning and made way too much noise. i called the front desk several times complaining about the noise. each time they assured me they would deal with the noise, but the racket never dissipated and i finally gave up getting any sleep. i did go back to the lobby before my trip ended to complain of the poor service that they have given me, the manager said that she felt sorry for the trouble i had been having at the hotel, but did not offer any refund or consolation for the trouble. when i left the ambassador east, i vowed that if i ever returned to chigaco, i would never stay at this place again.
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago is located in the heart of downtown chicago, illinois on north michigan avenue, the magnificent mile. this hotel is located within moments, not minutes, from the navy pier, millennium park, and magnificent mile shopping. the intercontinental chicago boasts a modern fitness center that feature free weights, a cardio room, dry saunas, as well as, masseurs. when business knocks at your door, the hotel has a 24 hour business center providing high-speed internet access, fax, and photocopying services. the accommodations at the intercontinental chicago are elegant with a touch of historic decor. the room had a breath-taking view of chicago, as well as, had an in-room mini-bar, terry-cloth bath robes, over-sized desks, high-speed internet access, and a 37-inch hi def lcd television. not only was the overall quality of the property in stunning condition, the staff at the intercontinental chicago were welcoming, caring, and demonstrated a profound customer-service base.
deceptive	the windy city fairmont hotel is one of chicago's best recently renovated to bring it up to modern day luxury. with fine dining atmosphere and hotel deluxe suites and the view that is breath taking. this hotel can accommodate the guest no matter what you desire. with a fabulous restaurant on the 15th floor with dinning at its best. with it over looking the great chicago area. so the next time your in the windy city come and stay with us where you will be pamper by our fine staff.
deceptive	my wife and i spent our honeymoon in chicago this summer. during this time we stayed that the hotel allegro. i knew this would be a positive experience from day one when i actually booked our reservations, the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous, and the whole process was quick, easy, and painless. upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon, the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease. the rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent. five stars and two thumbs up.
truthful	it is always interesting going to a high quality hotel. i cannot help but think about the service and the value. maybe i have too high expectations. certaintly the location is great and the swimming pool is really nice and the room was generally well appointed oh and the bed was great. but, the room was not well cleaned, a little smelly truthfully and they stole a watch that i left in the room. the hotel where immediately worried about there financial situation and not the service. i noticed here others on this site have lost stuff from this hotel. i know that this is always a possibility but really did not expect it at a hotel like this. overall, chicago exceeded my expectations but the intercontinental did not. stay else where.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago while on a business trip. i have to say that i was very displeased with the service i received during my stay. even though their website boasts that their staff will be at your beck and call, i found them to be very rude. the beds were extremely uncomfortable and the noise level very high. i was awakened by guests in the next room several times. even though i complained to the front desk, they did not resolve the issue. i definitely would not recommend this hotel and i will be staying at a different hotel if i am in the area again.
truthful	i visited chicago with my two teenage daughters. homewood suites is amazing. the complimentary breakfast and receptions offer so much variety. the hotel was within walking distance to many places to eat and shop. we got caught in a thunderstorm, and got soaking wet. i dried all our clothes in the dryer right in the hotel! the homewood suites was so much like home. the suite was very spacious and had everything we needed. the hotel had lots of brochures and suggestions for dining and activities. the staff was so friendly and helpful. chicago is an amazing place and the homewood suites is the place to stay. i would definitely stay there again.
deceptive	luxury and comfort combine to give a wonderful sense of relaxation for guests at the omni chicago hotel. their rooms are some of the cleanest and most well-furnished i have ever seen at a four-diamond hotel, and the 676 lounge, which has accommodating late hours, was perfect for me to relax after a day of work. the workout room is absolutely huge, and each treadmill has its own tv to watch while working out - fantastic! overall, my experience at the omni was amazing. i'll definitely be coming back the next time i'm in chicago!
truthful	i've used priceline for every trip i've made back to chicago and i've been fortunate to have stayed in some excellent hotels downtown. this was my first and last stay at the ambassador east. its conveniently located near the clark/division stop on the el's red line. that is the best part of our experience. when we checked in we were charged additional for upgrading from a king bed to two queens. i've never had that issue at any other hotel i've stayed at. the room's decor was outdated and the tv was tiny. the hotel charges for usage of internet. you could hear people in the hallway and when you're in the hallway you could easily hear people in the rooms. we weren't in chicago to stay in the hotel however, for people that might want a romantic weekend this definitely isn't the place. ...read more
deceptive	this is one of the best hotels i have ever been in. i went there to see about scheduling my reception party, and was amazed at the architecture of the building, the interior design of the rooms, and the massive spacing provided for each room. now i recommend this hotel to my associates to hold their important business meetings in the james club, so that after the meetings, we can partake in a nice meal and drinks. which brings me to my next point. the james has some of the best food i have ever eaten!!! the james private club, i feel was made for the elite and upper class. very classy, very elegant. the customer service is outstanding. i recommend this hotel to anyone needing to hold a reception, business meeting, or just need to have a day at the spa. 5 stars all the way!!!
deceptive	james chicago would be one of the worst hotels i have ever been to in my life! even though i noticed that the design of the place was extremely artistic, its service quality and hotel conditions were horrible. they gave me a room in which the blankets were dirty and looked as if it been used just moments ago! i figured it was because the hotel was busy but i started to notice that the furniture came with a cost in service. the television was not working at all. i was extremely disapointed, especially when coming from a rigorous day of work and just wanting to relax. sadly, i settled in doing my work instead of frittering my time doing noting when i got the next disapointment. the wifi was a bust. absolutely nothing to do but to stare at the furniture or just stare at the wall. i am never going to james hotel ever again!
truthful	"this was our third trip to chicago this year (we love the city!) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel. swissotel was definitely our favourite. when we come back in july to see the play "" wicked"" for the second time, we will be again at swissotel. no more need to try other hotels! the location is good because it is between the financial district and the magnificent mile. the room was spotless and quiet, the view amazing and those elevators were so fast. comfortable beds, friendly service, not as many noisy sirens! we even watched the navy pier fireworks from our bed! this was the best anniversary ever. we would recommend swissotel to everyone!"
truthful	we choose to stay at the hotel due to the high rooftop ratings at the hotel. not only is the rooftop terrace on the 5th floor, but it was occuppied with private corporate events for the entire duration of our stay. we did - as recommended - have a drink indoors only to be highly insulted by their bartender there. there is no breakfast buffet - you order a la carte. keep that in mind when paying extra for breakfast and internet. also note that the minibar is empty on arrival - we were only told on departure that we would have needed to call reception to order. we have stayed at the omni before and it as a much better experience. i dont recommend spending so much for a mediocre hotel.
truthful	i want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service. 1) sylvia rollins, head concierge. i wanted a fairly last minute reservation at mk restaurant. i spoke with sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within 15 minutes had the desired reservation. 2) ryan lettier, concierge, provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises. our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the monaco. 3) turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard 4) even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel. the rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal hotel monaco feel. beds and bedding both very comfortable. the complimentary happy hour and morning coffee/tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests.
deceptive	as a frequent traveler for both business and pleasure, clean and comfortable accommodations at a reasonable price are important to me. homewood suites chicago provides all of that and more! the room was spacious and immaculately kept, with all the tools you could need to prepare a meal in the full-sized kitchen. after a busy work day, it was wonderful to be able to kick back in front of the huge flat-screen television to relax, with a spectacular backdrop of the city outside. i will definitely book a room next time in chicago and i'll definitely continue to stay at homewood suites in other cities.
deceptive	"my wife and i booked a room at the hilton chicago three weekends ago, as this is a downtown hotel and a well known brand we knew we were going to have to pay a little more but for that additional price we were expecting to get a quality hotel. we were expecting some minutia of luxury. however, this was not the case with the hilton chicago. first, we had reserved a room with a king size bed, but they did not have any available and we were stuck with a queen size bed. now, we did get a reduced price because of this, but we had made a reservations and expected to be accommodated as we had asked. second, we had to change our room key twice. the room keys they used supposedly lost their ""charge"". this is what the front desk told us. so, we had to go up to our room, find out the key didn't work, then come back down stairs get a new key, then get back in. this was highly unprofessional, and they really need to look into their key system. lastly, we were told at the end of our stay that we had no charges on our room. we knew this was accurate, but i always check just in case. but two weeks later when i checked my credit card an additional two hundred dollars of charges were on my card. i had to call and argue with them for twenty minutes before they took it off my card. suffice it to say we will not be staying there again."
deceptive	"i stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago recently for a convention i was attending. this was my first trip to chicago and i had no idea what to expect and this hotel came recommended by a colleague so i had high expectations. check-in took a bit longer than i would have liked as they were experiencing computer problems and the staff at the front desk had to call their main reservation line to confirm reservations. once i did get into my room, there was a strong cigarette odor in spite of the fact that it was a non-smoking room. i went down to the front desk and requested a room change. given their computer problems, that took almost an hour and the staff was quite surly and didn't have the ""positive attitude in spite of any difficulty"" i'd expect from such a high profile establishment. the new room was not a suite as i had originally booked but it was significantly fresher smelling. when i hooked up my laptop, i was dismayed to discover that there was no wi-fi service. i had made my reservation online to take advantage of their free wi-fi for online ressies, but as part of their computer problems, the wi-fi service was down. fortunately, there was a starbucks up the street with available wi-fi. granted, i couldn't lounge at the starbucks in my jammies like i could in my hotel room, but connectivity for work is necessary so we make sacrifices. i was determined not to let computer problems color my opinion of the hotel as it's not something that is necessarily under the control of local management. however, the hair in the bathroom sink and the wet washcloth that was on the floor behind the toilet are definitely under the control of local management. a quick call to housekeeping got a promise to give the room a once over while i was down the street at starbucks. they did as promised and when i arrived back at the room there were no stray bits of previous customer's dna and the dust bunny population had been eradicated. once i had a chance to relax in the room, there were a few minor details that stood out. the carpet was starting to get worn in places, the edges on some of the furniture was dinged, and my personal pet peeve... the inside of the drawers were rough, unfinished wood which i dislike as the little splinters can cause runs in my clothes. i would have expected higher quality furniture for such a hotel. but, all things considered, my stay was tolerable. water pressure was good and it was quiet enough at night to get decent sleep. the wi-fi was still down in the morning so i checked out early and spent my time enjoying a latte and free wi-fi at starbucks."
deceptive	i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel in chicago and was very disappointed right from the beginning. the girl at the front desk was busy talking to a one of her friends and when i finally did get her to wait on me she was rude and seemed bothered to have to wait on me. the room wasnt at all what i was expecting. it was dingy, dirty, and just seems like an old hotel. just not what i was looking for in a nice hotel. seemed like the quality you'd expect from a cheap motel.
deceptive	overall, the hotel is beautiful. the service was great. all the employees were friendly and always willing to help. my room on the north end had a great view of the city and the chicago river. the bed and big fluffy pillows were very comfortable and relaxing. the only downfalls were parking and the fitness room. parking was a little on the pricey side and not exactly as close to the hotel as one would think it should be. the hotel itself is huge with over 1500 rooms, so you may feel like your getting your daily exercise in just walking from your room to the fitness center depending on where your room is located.
deceptive	my husband and i loved this hotel. the staff were friendly, the food on the room service menu was a reasonable price, and we got an extra (free) coffeepot in our room immediately when we asked for it. highly recommended!
deceptive	my fiancee and i were looking for a modern, upscale venue for our wedding reception. we have found the perfect location at the james. from the ballroom to the personal attention to detail, each step was handled with care. now that we have locked in our date, we are more excited than ever. thank you staff at the james for making our day even more special!
truthful	my husband and i had a wonderful stay at the omni chicago hotel. i had contacted the customer service representative prior to our stay to request a quiet suite. when we arrived, she greeted us and confirmed that we were getting exactly what i had requested--and more. our suite had a partial view of the lake!!! and, we were able to check in early. the service at this hotel is incredible. everyone made us feel welcome and took care to respond to any question or request that we had. the suite was very quiet even though we were on the east side of the hotel, very near to michigan avenue. housekeeping was prompt and thorough. we really couldn't have asked for a better hotel. we will definitely stay there on future trips to chicago and will recommend this hotel to anyone who travels there.
deceptive	our stay at the james in late last august exceeded our expectations. my husband was in chicago for a business trip, and i tagged along to have some time away from our day to day life. when we entered the hotel we were greeted acknowledged the minute we walked through the doors, and the staff member at the front desk was extremely friendly. he met our needs in a timely manner and patiently answered our questions. the lobby was clean and the ambiance was impressive. our room was also very clean. i could not have found a better room for those two nights of peace and quiet. the bed was comfortable, and the bedding was the type you could slip into and drift off in. it has been awhile since i have stayed at a hotel where the comforter was not scratchy or too thin. my husband actually commented that he had not seen me sleep that soundly in over a month. the bathroom was also impressive. the water pressure was not something i had to mess with to get perfect, and the heater took no time at all to warm up. even though i had brought my own shampoo and conditioner, i did give the amenities in the bathroom a try, and like everything else they exceeded my expectations. i did not get a chance to check out the conference rooms, however, my husband had nothing but great things to say about the qualities of the facilities. i truly enjoyed the location and ambiance of this hotel, and if we are ever in the chicago area again we will definitely be staying here. this hotel met all of our needs from relaxation to business to pleasure.
truthful	"my husband and i and our 10 month old took a quick trip to chicago. we stayed one night at the palmer house after reading that they were a four star hotel. i guess i am just confused as to why they are a four star hotel. yes the lounge area is nice but the rooms were so small i couldn't set up a pack and play for my son. i had to call and ""upgrade"" my room just so my son could have someplace to sleep. the lower levels have been updated which makes them slightly better than a holiday inn. the wall paper is peeling away from the walls and the shower was dirty. i will never stay there again."
deceptive	i went to chicago and we made a reservation to hotel monaco chicago which is a kimpton hotel, and i decided to stay in a tranquility suite. which was amazing i went with my family and all of us had a comfortable space. room service was great served quickly and the cleaners clean quick. another thing was that it was pet friendly which i thought was cool meaning you could bring your dogs. the hotel was amazing and beutiful.
truthful	we had a king deluxe room for 2 nights. we reserved the room through the hotel website with aaa discount. we paid $180/nt. we enjoy boutique hotels, as they have so much more personality and personal service. this hotel was no exception. every employee we encountered was pleasant and helpful. the room was clean, well decorated, spacious and quiet. we were offered at check-in a room with a view, but warned it was across from the elevator, so we decided to take the quiet, large room with no view. the location of the hotel was perfect for us, we saw wicked while in chicago and had no problem walking to the theater. we also walked the magnificient mile and found the location perfect (we like to walk). we had drinks at the hotel restaurant both nights which was a pleasurable experience. we ate room service for breakfast each morning, and the food was good and the portions were quite large. we would definitely stay here again.
deceptive	the sheraton chicago is not the place to be if you want to experience chicago. there are no customer services to provide you with ideas of what to do, and there aren't even any shuttles that will bring you around town. the food in the restaurant at the hotel serves mediocre burgers and fries, and makes no attempt to emulate the chicago culture. there are a million other hotels in chicago, and this is one of the most average. the rooms are fairly decent sized, but they lack amenities like wi-fi and mini bars. the view is nothing special, and the concierge is anything but responsive to phone calls.
deceptive	"dissapointed with my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park. when i looked at its web site i was convinced this was going to be the perfect place for my family and i to spend time in, when not gazing the ""sites"" in chicago. boy was i wrong, when i first arrived to check in there was no one insight at the desk. finally, after about 20 minutes, i was approached with no apology for my wait. while trying to check in they told me there was a mixup and the room i originally requested was occupied, i was given a less spacious room, one bed for my wife and i to share with the kids, and was told they would voucher my meals that day. my wife and i love sushi so we figured we use it on that. when we were done not only was the quality of the food mediocre but they told us the voucher would not work for the sushi bar. worst display of customer service i have ever received and will never stay there again."
deceptive	do not stay at this hotel!!!! i would have certainly expected more from the hilton, especially due to the price i paid for my room and the way the hotel is portrayed. upon arriving at the hotel i found only one receptionist working and she was too busy texting on her mobile phone to check me in! i had to wait 15 mins before checking in and she made me feel like i was inconveniencing her! when i finally got into my room i was appalled. i had a non smoking reservation and the room stank of smoke and there were several visible cigarette burns in the comforter and the carpet. i called down to reception and to confirm that i was in a non smoking room, which i was advised that i was. i had to argue with the receptionist over the room for 10 mins before she agreed to switch my room for another one. one i entered my new room, i found that once again it stank of smoke, but after being too exhausted from my flight i decided that i would sort it out with reception in the morning. bad idea! i curled up and went to sleep and awoke to the go to the bathroom around 2am where i noticed my legs were covered in red welts! i immediately rushed back into the bedroom and through back the covers to find my bed teaming with bed bugs. i packed my stuff and checked out that night, however a refund was refused. i have since contacted the head office and i am awaiting a response. do not stay here!!!
deceptive	our stay at the hilton chicago was a pleasure from arrival to departure. the staff was super friendly and helpful, the room was very clean and the location was fantastic. the walking track was an especially nice touch. highly recommended!
truthful	great building and location, but... staff is indifferent, you have to pay for wifi (after $300 usd/night i would expect at least free wifi), no pool in the building and something i found really annoying is that, if you move anything from the minibar, they have sensors that automatically charge you. this is ridicoulus.the ipod dock in the room didn't work. also, we had to move thenightstand between beds and found dirt all over. definitely is not value for your money. you're just paying for the hard rock brand. i will never go back to a hard rock hotel.
deceptive	homewood suites is a hilton group hotel located in downtown chicago. though close to many sights, when we visited there was extensive construction going on along michigan avenue, so every morning we were awakened right at 8 am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers. we reserved the basic suite. though we arrived at 5 pm, well past check-in time, our room was not ready for 30 minutes. the management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience. once the suite was ready, it was nice. but then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom. we were relocated to another room with apologies, but again, no offer of compensation for the trouble. once we were finally settled, the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer. the food was okay, but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point. the staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service. we though it was a good idea since we were already so tired. unfortunately, it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected. all in all we were disappointed with our experience at homewood suites. we understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable. i would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting chicago.
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers for three days while i was in chicago on business. this was quite possibly the best hotel experience that i have ever had, which says a lot considering the fact that i stay in hotels quite frequently. the staff was extremely friendly and very accommodating. they made sure that i had absolutely everything that i could want or need. their friendliness came across in a very genuine manner, not fake or forced like some employees can be. the room itself was to die for. the bedding was so soft and the room was extremely clean and well kept. i cannot speak highly enough about the quality of the mattress and bedding! because of the mattress and bedding, i got the best three nights of sleep i've ever had. the views of downtown chicago were absolutely amazing from my room. the way the city lights sparkled stole my heart and almost made me want to move to chicago. the food was amazing also. i made it a point to eat at all three of the hotel's restaurants and visit the bar while i was there. my favorite restaurant of the three was shula's steak house. the chi bar, the hotel's bar, was amazingly designed and the drinks were great. all in all, i would rate my experience a 5 out of 5. there is nowhere else in downtown chicago that compares to the sheraton.
truthful	i had a great time here! it is centerally located in chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent. the staff was amazing and very helpful! parking was a bit steep, but to be expected. the room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable. the yoga mat rental was wonderful as well! wonderful and relaxing experience overall.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hyatt regency in downtown chicago. my stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff. i needed to do some research for work and the free wi-fi made this very easy. the bed was so nice and soft! even the pillows were fluffy. i was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe. the local restaurants were amazing. i will recommend this to my friends and i am staying here again in the future.
deceptive	for our anniversary this year, my wife and i stayed at the conrad. we're from the suburbs, so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us. it's expensive, so we expect the best for our money. this was most definitely not the best for our money. it wasn't even a good deal either. the problems began right off the bat. when we got to our room, we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room. it was like walking into a dusty attic. when i sat down to watch tv, it turns out it wasn't even connected to cable or anything. i kept changing the channel, but it was nothing but static and white noise. i even looked for another remote. after we left our things, we went out for a night in chicago, but coming back, the smell seemed to have gotten worse. i finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms. they moved us to a different room, but they had no explanation for the smell. for a single stay, that was more trouble than it was worth.
deceptive	the hotel was not one of the better ones i stayed at. the room was seemingly nice at first, but after staying there for a few days it seemed like the cleaning staff never came through to clean it. i had the same sheets for a three days before i called and requested they be changed. also, the walls seem to be paper thin and you can hear what is going on in the adjacent rooms, which interfered with my sleep. i ate at the primehouse in the restaurant also, and asked for a well done steak, and the steak was still pretty pink on the inside and lacked flavor. this is definitely not a hotel i would recommend to anyone.
deceptive	"my wife and i were excited to visit and shop at chicago's magnificent mile on michigan ave. we chose the intercontinental hotel for it's reputation and location. man oh man, were we disappointed. the check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well. we got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains. there were six people in line for her and we had to wait. that was no problem since we weren't on a timetable. when we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the miracle mile, she just pointed to the door and said, ""it's right out the door."" i asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying, ""there's no such thing."" i couldn't believe her abruptness. we left the concierge stand not wanting to return. shopping went well and was fun. we returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge. we couldn't find a hotel directory in the room. i called the housekeeping department and was told, ""we're all out of directories here in the office."" i asked if they could check a vacant room for one. she said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms. i hung up and thought i would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages. guess what? you guessed it, no phone book in the room. i figured we could go get a drink at the bar, the hotel's 20's themed lounge, and ask the bartender for suggestions. we went to the bar and there were only three other customers. we sat at the bar and got our drinks. as i was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions, his cell phone rang. he answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk. twenty minutes later, he was still on the phone. tired and hungry, my wife and i went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from pizza hut. although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable, the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back. a big thumbs down to the intercontinental chicago. they need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary."
deceptive	although the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago claims to be an affordable upscale hotel in the heart of chicago, it is somewhat expensive, starting at $200 per night. there are very few special discount rates available for the budget conscious traveler. the rooms are modern looking and a little less cozy than one might prefer. the carpeting in the rooms is a little outdated and somewhat dirty in a few areas. the views from the rooms are not as great as they could be. the hotel seems to be understaffed and the heating unit in the room is hard to adjust to the right temperature. although the hotel is located on chicago's famous michigan avenue, it is a $40 taxi ride from o'hare airport and a $36 taxi ride from midway airport, both rather pricey options. if you chose to drive there, the valet parking charge is a hefty $53. again, not very budget friendly. all in all, even though the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago is close to some of the major chicago attractions, it is only an average hotel on many levels.
deceptive	this hotel was wonderful. my room was clean and the staff was courteous. the food provided by the restaurant was exceptional. this was on of the best hotel stays, ive experienced. i highly suggest this hotel to others.
deceptive	"while making the obligatory trip to the chicago area to visit family, we decided to make it fun for the teenage members of our group and reserved a couple of rooms at the hard rock hotel chicago. what a great decision! the rooms are very upscale at a reasonable price with great amenities. and, according the younger members of the family, ""very cool""! we can't wait to come back."
truthful	this hotel has a great location, and very friendly staff. however, the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition. i use to be a regular at this hotel . . . but have not been back for 15 years. rooms have not been well maintained (old carpets frayed at doors), wall paper peeling off of the walls, tv's from the 80's. there is currently construction going on in the lobby area, making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door.
truthful	we stayed at this hotel for a conference. the lobby and the conference areas were immaculate. the restaurants (one of which was shula's steakhouse) and bars were great. the saff was exteremely helpful. the rooms left a lot to be desired...our nonsmoking room smelled of smoke. the a/c system was ancient and tempermental, and the bathroom was old and in need of a makeover. it was surprising to see since the physical plant was so nice. we would choose, however, to stay elsewhere. espcially for the money we paid.
truthful	a friend highly recommended this hotel and we couldn't have been happier! it was wonderful ~ my husband and kids were already planning our next trip there before we had even left the hotel. the kids loved the goldfish in the room and thought the window seats were the best.
truthful	we stayed at the conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion. the room was clean and new feeling, nice city view, free bottled water in room upon arrival. check in was a breeze, and our room was ready even though we were several hours early. all staff was friendly and helpful, excellent breakfast.
truthful	got a good deal on a weekend pacage in this hotel and have to say it is the nicest stay i have had in more than a dozen business trips to chicago. all rooms are suites, staff is friendly and professional, restaurant is out of this world and all the extras like a great health club, turn down service, complimentary morning beverages delivered to room and on and on. room was very clean and every need was attended to without feeling intruded on. will definately stay here again.
truthful	great location and quality place to stay. lovely large clean room with a queen size bed it was great. staff were very helpful and put us onto some great restaurants and then some music bars. coleman on the front desk was a great guy to meet as a first impression he sold the hotel to us with his personality. the hotel delivered an anniversary cake to us in our room (compliments of the hotel) for me this showed that they care about their guests many thanks to all it was a great place to stay.
truthful	we went with the great reviews on tripadvisor. the location, rooms, amenities and price via expedia were good. my complaint is the poor service at every stage - the check-in was slow (even at 1am), the concierge (sarita) was hopeless, staff were generally rude. also there was some sort of generator box under the bed which hummed all night - we turned it off and it also seemed to turn off the air conditioning. finally, just to let you know that there is a major construction site in front of the hotel and roadworks at 2am with trucks that beep continuously everytime they reverse!!! would i stay here again? - maybe if i got a good deal and had a back room but there are plenty of other great hotels nearby.
truthful	i stayed at the allegro in july for 4 nights for a business trip. the room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. i had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. the decor is a lot of fun. we were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. the front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. we were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to navy pier. for people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a dunkin donuts about a block away. i definitely recommend this hotel!
deceptive	quite simply the hyatt regency chicago is the business traveler's best friend. recently i had to attend a seminar in chicago and stayed at the hyatt. to say i was impressed would be an understatement. centrally located in the heart of downtown, the hyatt has perfected the art of ultimate guest satisfaction. on arrival the staff goes into overdrive. they make you feel like you are the only guest in this huge hotel. the rooms are very big and elegantly furnished with 100 percent cotton linens. my room came equipped with flat screen tv, wi-fi and high speed internet. room service was quite extensive and if it was not on the menu they went out of their way to accomodate you. there were also car rental on site as were restaurants, cocktail bar and a 24 hour dining room. they have state of the art conference rooms with high tech features. there is also catering and limo service. the staff is multilingual and the concierge service is very professional. all in all they will pamper you from head to toe and other parts in between. this hotel is definitely worth the price and i will definitely return not as a business traveler but as a tourist who wants to be pampered. my only regret? that i could not stay much longer.
truthful	i stayed here for about a week during a conference and the service was excellent. in addition to the excellent service the location was great. with quick access to michigan ave.. the bars and shula's restaurant were excellent. you must have the rib-eye steak...very well done.
deceptive	conrad chicago is one of the nicer hotels i have had the pleasure of staying in recently. the rooms were well furnished and brightly lit, but not to the point of garishness. the convenient location was a plus.
truthful	great front desk staff, the rest of the experience was dreadful. the room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained i have ever encountered. we had to ask four times for the staff not to slam the supply closet, adjacent to our room (almost in the room itself). they do these random room checks for the minibar, as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $9 peanuts. the roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones. if you like sleeping in on your vacation, don't stay here. also, the hotel was under massive construction, a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website. so we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it. no discount because of the work and noise. i'd rather sleep in a box in the alley.
truthful	my wife and i stayed at the amalfi on a trip to visit our son and some friends from norway who were vacationing in the city. we were excited about staying at the amalfi after reading the reviews here, but really disappointed in the accommodations. the web site has a photo of the 18 story building that houses the hotel. it doesn't state that the hotel only occupies the first 6 floors of the building. the rest are offices. our room was on the 4th floor with a view of a blank brick wall about 16 feet distant. the room itself was unremarkable, with standard furnishings equivalent to a holiday inn. although it is close to the best part of the city, it is tucked behind the new trump tower and opens on a surprisingly sketchy stretch of road/sidewalk. our norwegian friends, by contrast, stayed on the 33rd floor of swissotel and had views of the lake and navy pier.
deceptive	the pictures on this website sure are deceiving! in real life the palmer house hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be! the cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning! now, granted it was only 15 minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but i thought that was the only weird thing i would have to put up with on that trip. it wasn't! they charged us for a mini-bar fee when we don't even drink, no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway! they also did not get our wake-up calls to us on time, so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip. we had to spend $50 extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we'd planned! and then it wasn't as good because the tour guide wasn't there and we got lost! my husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one. it was terrible! i certainly won't be staying here again!
deceptive	"since this was our first visit to the ""windy city,"" we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. we read many great reviews regarding the kimpton brand so we gave it a go. the ""go"" ended up being a ""no go."" we were sorely disappointed. when we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. we have two kids with us, so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. we were told ""no problem."" unfortunately, it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. then, we noticed a bug (or bugs) near the fridge area. yikes! we called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room (or floor!). our request was met about 30 minutes later. by this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. customer service was so lacking! we wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. this is not what we expected at all for this high price! will have to think hard before we book with a kimpton hotel again."
deceptive	i was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel. the overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance. given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level, this was most disappointing. nor was i impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff.
deceptive	there were many positives when staying in this hotel at the north end of the magnificant mile. the rooms were spacious and beautifully appointed with great attention to detail. the quality of service was excellent, the staff professional, and the location was perfect. there are great views of chicago from many of the rooms. the staff seemed to care about the quality of my stay from the moment i was greeted upon arrival to the moment i got in my taxi to leave. there is a nice rooftop bar/restaurant perfect for a lite meal or a refreshing cocktail with great views of the city. there really weren't any negatives and i would recommend this boutique hotel to anyone staying in the chicago area.
deceptive	my husband and i recently went to chicago for my aunt's funeral. we are not familiar with the area so we asked for recommedations of where to stay for the two nights we would be in town. we were told to stay at the ambassador east hotel. i wish we could say that our experience there was a good one, but sadly, it was one of of the more disappointing travel experiences we have had. upon check in we were quickly shown to our rooms, but when we entered our king suite a very strong, musty smell greeted us on the other side. at first i thought i was just being sensitive, but after about an hour in the room we simply had to request to be moved. the smell was too overwhelming. the front desk said they would be happy to move us, but the only other room available was a suite with two double beds, rather than the king bed suite we originally reserved. while this was not exactly what we wanted, we didn't really have a choice to refuse. after transfering to the new room and getting settled, we discovered that the electrical outlet near the sink in the bathroom did not work. while this did not bother my husband too much, i was very annoyed, as i need the mirror while i use my hair dryer, curling iron, etc. i absolutely did not want to have to switch rooms yet again, so i simply had to make due with doing my hair next to the bed. they also only gave us two towels of any kind in the bathroom, so we had to request washcloths and small hand towels, both days we were there! each time the housekeeping staff seemed incredibly annoyed at these requests. for what we paid to stay at this hotel, we were not impressed at all. the customer service was lackluster and the rooms were not up to par. if you are ever in chicago, do yourself a favor and stay somewhere else.
deceptive	i was on a business trip to chicago a while back and i had the unfortunate luck of staying at the intercontinental chicago hotel. i say unfortunate , because from the first moment i walked in my experience was poor. the front desk made me wait a very long time and i had to resolve an issue with my reservation. my receptionist had made the reservation and the room should have already been on or company account but they were insisting that i supply a personal credit card for the room. i understand their precautions but i travel a lot and usually do not encounter this situation. once that was all taken care of (several phone calls later) i was taken up to my room. it was nice and i was glad to finally be there, but the bell hope was very short with me and was very quick to throw out his hand asking for a tip, even though he had done nothing but groaned the entire time he was taking me to my room. i was very happy i only had to stay there two night because after my run in with the front desk i got the impression that no one wanted to deal with me. i will hopefully not be staying there again, and will suggest that it be avoided by all.
truthful	while the james was once considered an elegant, chic establishment, it has lost its luster. the small rooms are filled with cheap ikea type furnishings, our tiny bathroom flooded with water that escaped the shower curtain. showers and flushings from neighboring rooms sounded more like protective levies collapsing. the 2 small elevators could not handle the guests, and many of us were forced to walk down several flights of stairs rather then wait for extended periods of time. the thin windows could not contain street noise and sidewalk conversations were heard throughout the night. it was rather provocative to listen to the couple next door carousing, but also rather tacky & unsettling. it took more then 30 minutes for the valet to bring our car after we checked out. this hotel has lost it and the james sysndicate will have a difficult time competing in new york's soho when they try to open in september. new yorkers will not tolerate shabby incompetence.
truthful	after reading so many great reviews i booked the hotel monaco and was not disappointed. i booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens. the location was perfect - right by the river near michigan ave. - minutes walk to the el, millenium park, the theater district and shopping. the room was clean, a little larger than standard and nicely decorated. we had window seats in the room with a view of the river. there was starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening. to top it off, the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area.
