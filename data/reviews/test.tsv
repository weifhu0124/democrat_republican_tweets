truthful	we booked at another hotel a block away and spent a unhappy night. we walked over to the talbott and the courtiest staff showed us a room and we booked the rest of our stay. the room was very attractive and well furnished with double sinks in the bathroom. the tub is large and the shower a pleasure. the location was quiet as requested. the staff was always cheerful and very helpful. tim and stephanie provide excellent concierge services! the breakfast at the basil cafe is a great way to start the day. we travel a lot and appreciate the ambiance of a good hotel. i would highly recommend the talbott for your stay.
deceptive	my husband and i planned a romantic getway for past several months and was looking forward to spending the end of the summer in chicago. however our excitement soon turned to disappointment and frustrations upon our arrival. the hotel was quite charming when we walked in the door but then everything went wrong. the gentleman checking us in could not find our reservation and was quite impatient and rude once we showed our confirmation papers. the manager did make accomondations for us after much discussion back and forth. we did not have towels in the room when we checked in and it took at least an hour and several phone calls before the towels were sent to our room. needless to say, i was extremely tired and wanted nothing more than to take a warm shower and turn in. if we had not paid the total cost up front, we would have just left and check into another hotel.
deceptive	my stay at the affinia last weekend was ideal and i can't wait to return. i was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean, lovely room near the shopping downtown. affinia fit the bill. the location was perfect, just one block from the magnificent mile. the decor was modern and sleek, and my room was impeccably clean. they even have a pillow menu! the price was pretty reasonable, too. i'll definitely be back.
deceptive	the sofitel chicago water tower was horrible. the first tip off that this would be a bad experience is when we had called ahead to make sure it was ok to check in after hours and that a concierge would be available when we arrived only to find out that they didn't even have a record of our reservation. after much inappropriate arguing, they found our reservation and we were assured all would be fine. when we checked in we got a dirty room without any working wifi or tv. it took a few calls to get fresh towels and for them to turn the heat on so we could sleep comfortably. the next day we called to get our complimentary room service that most decent hotels provide free and they had no records of us even checking in. a quick check with the credit card company had they charge already pending in the wrong amount. we finally left in disgust and got a much better hotel, the fancypants hotel and suits with complementary airport shuttle and award winning preferred member rewards club. overall, the service at the sofitel was rude, rooms were unsatisfactory, restaurant sub-par, not well kept up or clean. in the future i would never stay there again and wold definitely pick a more reputable hotel with a proven track record, like the fancypants hotel and suits, my personal favorite.
truthful	this was a great hotel right in the heart of the chicago loop. within walking distance to the downtown attractions. parking is expensive ($50 p/nt) so we parked at a free remote location (recreation drive) since we weren't planning on driving once we checked in. the staff was friendly and helpful. the rooms are large and clean.
truthful	we also just returned from a frigid weekend in chicago. i booked the ambassador east because of its great rate, $89.00 with my aaa card and we were delighted. yes, the rooms show some signs of wear, but the warmth and charm far make up for it. this was such a pleasant change from the sleek, modern look of many other chain and boutique hotels. we became members of the i preferred program and were therefore eligible for an upgrade which we automatically got upon check in. we had a lovely suite with lots of sitting room and a comfortable bedroom and bathroom. we had wonderful food at the pump room which is classic. our oatmeal there was so tastefully served, i'd love to have some right now! the location was great. had it been normal winter weather, we could have easily walked to michigan avenue for shopping, but due to the minus 20 degree windchills, we opted for a cab which was less than a $5.00 fare. we also enjoyed a glass of wine around the fireplace in the lobby and found it so welcoming and cozy and not overcrowed at all. we would definitely stay here again!
truthful	the service from check-in to checkout was excellent - timely and efficient. the room was more then i has expected. it was spacious and laid out very well. i particularly enjoyed the living room area as well as the double closets and separate bath and shower. the bed abd pillows were extremely comfortable. i believe it's the first time i stayed in a hotel that provided a toothbrush and toothpaste in the room. the location was perfect for us as we were able to walk to everywhere we needed to go. i particularly enjoyed the excellent food at thechina grill which is attached to the hard rock hotel. the service was very good and the staff very friendly.
truthful	the hard rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway. the rooms are quiet, the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size. we had fabulous service and got a great rate. other than the fact that there were no bathrobes (it's listed as an amenity) and the sony radio didn't work, it was perfect. would definitely stay there again!
deceptive	my wife and i recently stayed at the allegro hotel in chicago and were extremely disappointed. it claims to be a luxury hotel, but the air conditioning in our unit wasn't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow. we phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of. noone ever showed up. aside from that, there were so many kids running around we couldn't think straight. this is just my two cents, but i'd would tell anyone considering staying at the allegro to pass and look at their other options.
truthful	very quaint and romantic, yet masculine. i've noticed that at most chicago hotel bars it's hard to get a drink much less a seat but i guess because it's a small hotel that was not a problem at the talbott - plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it's so inviting - cozy and comfortable - love that! would love to stay again but i must say that i was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds - ours was too firm. also note there is no gym on the premises - but walking and shopping is enough of a workout!
truthful	no bell boys there when you need them, sully staff, no smiles at all in this place. had to wait 30 min for my luggage and was never greeted by any of the staff. boy, sure is a lousy fairmont compared to the one in sf. never here again!
deceptive	my husband and i stayed here at the hard rock hotel in chicago a few months back. i wasn't particularly impressed with their customer service. when we arrived to check in, the front desk clerk was quite rude and unfriendly. she was short with me when i asked her about the city's attractions and things to do. our room wasn't all that great either. it was rather small and had a weird smell to it. i won't be staying here again.
truthful	"i loved it here! my boyfriend and i booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our 3 nights here. (i've paid more to stay at the santa barbara motel 6!!) gorgeous hotel, great staff, fun bar/lounge area and we were most impressed with the room. the large windows in the bathroom were the best--i took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of navy pier and the skyline. i remember thinking, ""this is really living..."" the room was comfortable and quiet, again with great views just like in the bathroom. chicago is a wonderful town--i have nothing but good things to say about it. can't wait to come back!"
truthful	stayed here for two days in the first week in january, when hotel was very quiet. got a big corner room. staff are friendly, decor is modern, and there's a huge choice of pastries and cakes and breads for breakfast, which you take back to your room. the free hors d'oevres with the drinks are great antipasti - olives, breads, cheeses and meats, marinated vegetables. this was a really easy hotel to stay in, fairly central - a couple of blocks away from the 'l', and quiet, despite the building work opposite. if you're in chicago, stay here.
truthful	my first trip back to chicago in about 7 years was perfect! i chose the knickerbocker as i had read that their rooms were recently renovated on top of being a great location to michigan avenue, rush street and downtown chicago. i must say i was very impressed with the guestrooms! i had not stayed there prior but it definitely is a refresh from what i've seen in photo's posted on the reviews. the guestrooms are nicely decorated with a modern feel and they are good sized for a historical hotel! the beds are wonderful -- i need to get a pillow top mattress at home! i used the internet access with no issue and i loved the larger screen tv's. the shower is fun with the different types of shower heads you can choose. and the bathrooms are fresh with all new granite and tile. i'm anxious to get back to chicago and it won't be 7 years from now! i would highly recommend this hotel -- fantastic guestrooms, location and staff! i've added some digital pictures of my room as they are completely different from the one's i saw on previous reviews with the new renovation.
truthful	i booked this hotel for $75 on hotwire with mid-level expectations for one night. totally blown away. arrived on a sunday night. gave car to valet ($51/night). lobby was a social people watching scene with swank music. check-in was smooth and easy. i asked for an upgrade and was told no free upgrades to 3rd party bookings. upgrade to suite was available at a cost. i passed since only 1 night stay. i asked for a nice, quiet room away from noisy housekeeping and ice machine. received room 10-120. room was huge with 2 beds. felt like 400 square feet. newly renovated last year. bell hop told me some rooms are very small so i totally lucked out! service from start to finish was top notch. everyone had a smile on their face. always spoke with great respect and made us feel welcome. ordered room service at 10:45 pm. arrived in 1/2 hour. food was so-so. had pancakes in lockwood for breakfast. very good food and very good service. strong coffee. hotel is right on state street shopping. fyi - rooms on floors 15 and below were renovated last year. rest were done 5 years ago. for the price, it was a great bargain! only complaint is bathroom is small.
deceptive	the palmer house hilton was recommended to me by a friend who had visited chicago the previous summer. i was very happy with the location , and was able to visit the nearby lake michigan and millennium park (beautiful!!). the rooms were good size , and the right amount of luxury for the price. i didn't use room service much , but when i did everything was in order.
deceptive	"my husband and i recently stayed at the conrad chicago for three nights, a thursday through saturday. let me say we were less than pleased with our experience. we chose to stay in the ""king bed deluxe room"" and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations. upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly, the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser. the room was size was average, and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room. the major annoyance was how loud people were. we came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running. that is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel. you can expect a loud guest maybe once, but every night is ridiculous. the service was also extremely sub par. we had to wait 20 minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work. one day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me. she completely disregarded the sign, did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in. it scared me and i'm just glad i was not getting out of the shower or changing. so to sum up, we will never stay at the conrad again, we will never recommend it to anyone else, and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in chicago."
truthful	we attended a bachorette party in chicago in aug 2005. there were 10 girls total. we had 5 rooms ... and i did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend. never been to chi-town before, i booked our hotel based on reviews from ta. and we were not disappointed. the staff is wonderful, the happy hour was just fabulous. the room was nice and clean, with a great double headed shower and aveda products was an extra bonus! then you also get free internet in your room! the hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness. we still talk about what a wonderful time we had ... and we all agree that if we ever go back to chicago we will be staying at the amalfi again. trust me the pics don't do it justice!
truthful	be prepared the hotel is old. it is on the historic list. the is updating to be done no doubt.. so just be forewarned. it is clean and the staff is phenomenal. having said that, you can not beat the location. right in the heart of the gold coast. take a train from o'hare right into the city. it drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel. one block from the beach and public transportation is right there. incredible area to explore. i highly recommend the ambassador east
truthful	as a frequent traveler for work, i stay at many spg properties. compared to all the spg property in chicago, this is by far the worst. why? 1) they charge you to use the gym. $12 per day or something like $24 for your entire stay. i can't even begin on what a rip off that is. 2) as a gold or platinum member, you always get a complimentary water bottle in your room. they do not offer that option here and you have to make a fuss about it before they give you one. 3) they do not have wireless internet. it is 2010- enough said. to charge you at least over $200 a night, all the above amenities should be built into that cost. i would never stay here again.
deceptive	an excellent vacation destination. clean rooms and many nice features. superb location and proximity to local attractions. staff is always friendly and eager to help. highly recommended to anyone looking to travel to this area.
truthful	stayed here october 31 through november 5 for a cconference. this is beautiful hotel and the location is perfect. the art institute and millenium park is a short 2 block walk from the hotel. my room was small, but beautiful. the bed was comfy and there were plenty of pillows. alas, no coffee maker in the room...the staff was helpful and friendly. i'd stay here again!
truthful	"we booked through a travel website. this hotel is currently undergoing major renovation and will be renamed in september. the public areas are still being renovated but the hallways and rooms are done. the hallway was so dimly lit, we couldn't see how to use the key card. the shock came when we entered the room. whoever designed it obviously did not take function or a guest's comfort into consideration. the bed was a mere 15 inches off the ground - a mattress (rock hard) over a platform. the ""nigh stands"" were shelves attached to the wall at around 12 inches height. the room was stark - all off-white, no color. no art work or any decoration at all. the full-length drapes completely blocked the air conditioning unit; if it were winter and the heat was on, i think this could be dangerous. there was a desk & chair but no clock/radio in the room; there was a wall mounted lcd tv with very poor channel selection. the bathroom was very small but clean. the problem with it was that the tub was almost 2 ft high and difficult to step in to. an older person could have never stayed in the room. because of the renovation, there was no restaurant on-site. no vending or ice available on the floor either i can't see anyone ever becoming a repeat guest at this hotel. i would never stay there again."
deceptive	my wife and i went to chicago to enjoy our weekend and stayed at hyatt regency. 'hyatt regency chicago' has ruined our family holiday weekend. first of all, if you are not a diamond or platinum member, you need to reserve the room atleast 10-15 days in advance. you have to pay extra $20 for the welcome credit option. they will give you a credit of $75 for the 2 days. we only used $20 and the rest was forefeited. i talked to the manager and he said we can't use it on our next visit. the management of the hotel is full of cheap minded people. when you know most of the hotels let you use their wi-fi for free, hyatt regency management asked us to pay for using their wi-fi. beware of this place, if you want to enjoy your weekend in chicago, hyatt regency should be the last place you should consider staying. thanks sam.
deceptive	this hotel is amazing, i would recommend everyone to stay at least one night here if they had the chance. i stayed here on my first honeymoon and they had all the accommodations i expected plus more. i was floored by the friendliness of the staff and they definitely went the extra mile to make everything perfect without any hassle. the restaurants at the fairmont were amazing as well. when staying at this hotel, food and wine at their best are portrayed. if i had to make the choice to stay here again, the only thing that i would do differently is schedule the stay to be twice as long (it was so relaxing!!). already booked another stay for next year i enjoyed it so much.
truthful	i choose the homewood suites in downtown chicago because i called them directly in search of a two bed room within walking distances of the attractions of chicago. well, when we arrived, it was apparent that there was chaos do to one of two elevators being out of service (which it had been since tuesday, this was saturday). once we finally got to the 6th floor to check in, i figured our relaxing time had begun. well, we got our room key and headed for the17th floor. again, waited for an elevator but finally made it two our room. i put the key in the door it opened to the surprise of me and the family already inside the room - yup we got double booked. the family was very nice and seemed ok with their surprise visitors. said our apologies and went back to the elevator and waited again to head back down to the 6th floor registration to figure the mess out. we have now been at the hotel for a half hour with no room and slightly annoyed. made it to the reservation desk and explained the situation. i did get an apology and a new room. new key in hand waited again for an elevator to bring us to the 9th floor for a new room. finally got to our room only to find it was a king suite. we are a family of four including two full grown teenage boys. there was no way they were going to fit on a pull out sofa. so, really annoyed now, i called the front desk and was told that were no rooms with two beds left even though i had specifically asked for two beds when i booked. it said two beds on preference on my reservation but the reservation agent assured me two beds would be available when i checked in. she went so far to but two beds on my reservation paper work. the operator said there are is only one two bed room on each floor. the only thing we got was a fold up bed that took away half the room in the living area. now, i paid a total of 349.00 for one night for this room. we got the mess mentioned above and a breakfast out of the deal. i am pretty sure my next trip to chicago will not include this hotel. i can tell you that we are frequent hws/hilton customers but this hotel will not be on our list of stops in the future.
truthful	the sheraton is a fantastic hotel. my wife and i stayed on the 29th floor overlooking the chicago river and lake michigan. the view was great. we got a corner room that also had a couch in. the hotel was just a short walk to the navy pier and the magnificant mile shopping area. food at the hotel was great. service from checking in to maid service was first class. great hotel, great town, highly recommend it.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago for business, but extended my stay through the weekend because i loved it! the accommodations exceeded my expectations. my bed was very comfortable, the room was big enough, and the shower was so relaxing. i had a great meal in the chop shop and the coffee was delicious at j's express. the fitness center was clean, and inspiring. i will recommend this hotel to others while in the area.
deceptive	my wife and i's stay at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers proved to be the perfect complement to our time spent visiting and exploring the windy city. upon our arrival, we were immediately welcomed by the beautiful design of the first-floor lobby and the friendly demeanor of the desk and bell service staff. in seemingly no time at all we were in our clean and well-furnished room with a beautiful and peaceful view of lake michigan. in terms of accommodations, i have never personally stayed at a hotel that i could complement more. on our very first night, my wife took advantage of a message therapy session while i swam a few laps in the heated indoor swimming pool. we followed our time apart with a very relaxing time at the chi bar, which had a very enlivening and laid-back atmosphere. retiring to our rooms, i couldn't help but remark to my wife about the quality of our room and the bed in particular. i had a very comfortable night's sleep and woke up just on time thanks to a spot-on wake up call from the desk staff. after a quick bite to eat the lb bistro, we headed out to sight-see. overall, i can't recommend the sheraton chicago hotel and towers enough. as far as this customer is concerned, it is the only place to stay if you are in the chicago area and are looking for accommodations with the best customer service, atmosphere, and amenities. i couldn't recommend it more.
deceptive	while the hotel certainly seems to look beautiful, the hotel is actually far from it. even booking a room online was rather difficult, and i wasn't able to reach a representative upon calling any of the contact numbers. in general coming here is a bad decision despite how it looks, its a mistake i wont make again and you shouldn't either.
deceptive	"we chose the talbott hotel primarily for the location, but quickly discovered that the location was the only good thing about it. although their website did a good job of selling their services and amenities, we found both severely lacking. we had mentioned to the reservationist when booking that this was to be a romantic weekend getaway for us - it was our anniversary. we asked for, and were promised, a king room. however, when we checked in, we were told by the front desk clerk that no king rooms were available. we could either take a double queen room, or pay significantly more for a suite. we took the key for our double queen room and were on our way. upon arriving on our floor, we found a rowdy group of young girls running up and down the hallway, squealing and playing. it turns out that this hotel offers american girl visits for the nearby store. it turns out that our romantic getaway room was in the center of a block of rooms reserved for a girl scout troop on an american girl trip! we went back downstairs to request a move to another room, and were told no other double queen rooms were currently available. we explained that we were here for our anniversary, and the ambiance wasn't exactly what we were looking for. the clerk rolled her eyes and told us that she couldn't help us - they didn't have anything else. sorry. back upstairs we went. tired from travel, we decided to order from room service for dinner. our pasta, when it arrived, was barely warm and mediocre in flavor. we ate it anyway and prepared for bed. after using the bathroom, we discovered that the toilet in our room continued to cycle water after flushing. after jiggling the handle a few times and poking around in the tank, we couldn't get the water to stop running. it took three hours for a maintenance staff member to make their way up to our room to fix the problem. the next morning, after showering, i discovered the hair dryer didn't work properly. after pulling my wet hair back in a clip, we went out for the day. upon our return, we expected to find our room made up and fresh. it hadn't been touched. we called downstairs to have someone sent up to clean it, but by the time we'd left for dinner, nobody had arrived. our room wasn't made up that day. that night, the girl scouts sat in the hallway giggling and singing until well after 1am. we asked them several times to be quiet, but they didn't want to listen, and their chaperones were nowhere to be seen. we called down to the desk, and they told us ""they would take care of it"", but the girls continued to have their party in the hallway anyway. nobody came to shoo them away. the next morning, i turned on the hairdryer, expecting it to work after reporting the difficulty the day before. it didn't! stuck wearing my clip again, we checked out and made a mental note to select another hotel in the area for our next trip. this hotel had potential, but the staff doesn't care enough about your experience to allow me to recommend it to other travelers."
truthful	any traveler who is loyal to a favorite hotel has experienced this sad truth: eventually the lodging deteriorates. but you do not expect the price to double and triple at the same time! i have been staying at the talbott for several decades. yes, changes have been made, like the updated heating and cooling systems and the front entrance, most recently. but other things have gone downhill. for the last several stays i have experienced very dirty carpets and slow service. rates have skyrocketed and now they are asking for 3 night minimum stays on many occasions. this is the kind of rate structure one might expect from the 5 star hotels within spitting distance of the talbott, but not this less-than-maintained lodging. i, personally, am shopping for a new home away from home.
truthful	my sister and i went to chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because i have a friend who works at homewood suites here in cleveland so we got a discount. the valets were really friendly, you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel. check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level. that also made finding the hotel tricky because i expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that i just had to pull over to the right side of the street. the lady at the front desk was friendly and informative. our room was very clean. the fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants, storing and reheating food. the complimentary breakfast was great! they have real food such as eggs, bacon, french toast, cereal, bagels, juice, milk, and yogurt. the hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to navy pier and passes by michigan avenue. they also have free wifi. overall, i would definately stay here again and i would recommend it to others.
truthful	on a recent trip to chicago to attend a major trade show i had the pleasure of staying with the sofitel chicago water tower. i say stay with as that is how they make you feel, from check in to check out they go above and beyond to ensure your stay is perfect and you want to return. the rooms are clean, chic and roomy, the beds - the best i have slept in, bathrooms large and super clean. what can i say, my new home when in chicago...
truthful	this was our second time staying here. we were very much looking forward to our weekend at the amalfi (based on how well the first stay was). it turned out better than our anticipation. the beds are very comfortable. 2 headed showers with a large bathroom. the hotel is also pleasantly quiet and easy to check-in and out. our room was near the exercise room which helped motivate us to get in an hour morning workout. then we were able to grab some complimentary fruit, pastries, juice and coffee on our floor (breakfast is on every floor). no great view from our room, but i don't think there are great views from most any room since it is only 5 floors. we didn't need to drive, take a cab or jump on the l the whole weekend since the hotel is centrally located. we easily walked to bars, blues clubs, restaurants, the hancock tower, the loop and the waterfront all from our hotel. the highlight of the hotel was the complimentary happy hour. free top-shelf drinks and wonderful meats, cheeses, peppers, and breads. this ran from 5:30 to 7:00, and was a great warm-up to a nice dinner. this alone saved us a bundle in money that would of been spent eating and drinking out in the evening. and an extra money-saving tip...park at the self-park lot 2 blocks west of the hotel on kinzie. its $24 per night during the week and only $6 per night on the weekends. i think the hotel charges $30 to $40 per night to park.
deceptive	don't stay here! my family and i stayed here for a weekend trip. the staff were rude and acted like we were bothering them. the rooms looked nice in photographs but when we got there our room looked like it hadn't been dusted in ages. overall bad service and not worth the money.
deceptive	upon my arrival at the hotel allegro in chicago i had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while i waited outside in the towncar. the bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. the front desk service rep was busy on the phone when i approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. once i recieved my key and entered my room i realized that i had been checked into a dirty room. i called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that i had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. she told me that i needed to come back down to the lobby. as i approched the desk i heard her yelling at a housekeeper. she then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. i didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so i just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. while i was waiting i watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was i not given that suite after what i just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. i went back up to the same room that i had previously entered. it was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. i called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. if my stay wasn't already horrible enough after i changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel i ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation i had made to be seated. the meal was ok but nothing like i had expected it to be when i read about it online. i can honestly say i will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.
deceptive	last week i stayed at the hilton chicago for 4 days and 3 nights and i was very pleased with the experience. as soon as i approached the front desk, i knew right away the staff was friendly and courteous. they had given me a list of local attractions such as the museum of science and industry, the broadcast museum, the ford center for the performing arts and willis tower. i stayed in a junior suite which included a king size bed, a 27 inch television, non-allergenic feather pillows and a variety of other amenities. the indoor pool was rather large as well as the gym which includes countless treadmills and even a jogging track. eating in the area is not a problem as the hilton chicago is home to kitty o'sheas which is a restaurant offering authentic irish fare. in conclusion, i had a wonderful time staying here and i can not wait to plan my return trip to the hilton chicago.
deceptive	"not worth the price! i had the unfortunate experience of staying in the hilton homewood suites in downtown chicago. i stayed there with my family while we were on vacation. i wish i would have saved my money and went somewhere else. with a hotel this expensive, you think that they might throw in some bonuses your way, like complimentary parking. not a chance. in addition to the $259 price tag, i also had to pay $30 for parking, per night. if i had stayed at the motel 6, parking would have been free. the staff there were not very nice at all. when i registered, the lady at the counter acted like helping me was interfering with her internet chat time. she was very rude to me. perhaps she was having a bad day or something, but i doubt it. after i arrived in my room, my key card didn't work, and i had to go back downstairs to get it fixed (once again, interrupting her precious free time with some actual work). the rooms had some nice features, like kitchen appliances and a flat screen television. i didn't go on vacation to cook though. the television didn't get very many channels, and you had to pay if you wanted to watch any of their movies (of course). i tried logging into facebook to say hello to my friends from the hotel room, but the ""complimentary"" internet access was so slow that it was hardly worth using. i get a better connection at starbucks. they offer a complimentary dinner and breakfast, but it's nothing to write home about. i've had better food at mcdonald's. the food was pretty cold, and the choices are very limited. traffic around the hotel was hideous. this hotel is downtown, and you can definitely tell. there are a bunch of one-way streets around, which makes getting in and out confusing. the room was pretty clean, but you can say that about a lot of hotels in a wide variety of price ranges. if you're looking for a hotel in chicago, i'd say save some money and go somewhere else. i've had better stays at the best western and many other hotels that cost less."
truthful	"got a great deal through hotwire for $70 a night but if i ever return to chicago i would definitely stay again, even at full price. we really liked the rooms muted modern decor, we had john lennon and bono for company. comfortable bed, mini coffe maker, plenty storage space and a lovely, clean bathroom stocked full of aveda products (so i was sold straight away...it doesn't take much, i know!). if you're a product junkie, tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies :) we liked the location and had a great view down n michigan ave, found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed (reception, gift shop and bar). the bar area is very trendy, i liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause i normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking...the lack of memorabilia didn't bother me but i was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway. the only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh, and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a ""friendly lady looking for business"" when he was at the bar. i think it's a place you will either love or hate, if you like laid back, contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you!"
truthful	attended a conference at the palmer house and it truly surpassed my expectations. i had no idea it would be so large, so nice and with so many amenities. i also didn't realize that it is just around the corner from milenium park and the art institute. we were met at the door by the friendliest staff. even with a long line at check-in, the entire process was about 10 minutes. we enjoyed the room with the up-to-date tv, decent size bathroom and comfortable bed. had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant. paid $200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown chicago. we have stayed at the sofital which is much more upscale, but we also paid over $300/night there.
truthful	just back from spending memorial day weekend in chicago. we decided to stay at the talbott, and we reserved a room there over a month ago. i must say that we found the staff to be wonderful, but the accommodations to be quite disappointing. we were given room #1605. avoid this room at all costs! the adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night (and then awaken you at 6 am). in addition, we had requested a king bed, and #1605 has two doubles. we were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room. despite the very friendly staff and its super location, the talbott was less than what we expected, and we would probably not stay there again.
deceptive	"i stayed at the knickerbocker hotel the last time i visited chicago. i lived in illinois during college, and as i was on a college budget, most of my trips up to the city involved sharing a room at one of the cheaper hotels away from downtown. for my visit back, i decided i would treat myself to a nicer stay than i was used to, so i booked a room at the knickerbocker. everything looked nice when i got there, but for the price i paid, i was really expecting something far above and beyond what i got. maybe i wasn't dressed right, or didn't carry the right luggage, but the front desk clerk was unnecessarily snooty when i checked in. shouldn't a hotel try to make its guests feel welcome? when i stayed at the cheap hotels in college, the front desk employees were always friendly when i checked in and out, and they would give me good tips on the best way to get to the fun things in the city. here, i didn't even want to ask for any tips at the front desk because i didn't want to deal with the eye rolling and ""too important to be bothered"" attitude i got when i checked in. i guess the location was more convenient than the hotels i used to visit, but i really thought that part of the money i was spending on a nice hotel would pay for a pleasant customer service experience. look, obviously i can afford to stay at your hotel, i already booked and paid for the room. even if customer service isn't your number one goal, making money should be pretty high up on the list, and making a paying customer feel unwelcome isn't a very good way to secure return business. i doubt i'll stay here again."
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers on a recent trip to chicago, and had a great stay. the rooms were beautiful, the beds comfortable, and the views of the city were fantastic. my room overlooked the river and the city. i felt like i was on a luxury vacation. the hotel has a few different restaurants. i ate at the chicago burger company, which was delicious. the burgers were juicy, and the prices were great. the indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities. overall, i had a wonderful stay.
truthful	i stayed at the palmer house for @ $150/night on a corporate rate. the bed was excellent, the linens/towels were top of the line. i did not find my room shabby, as other reviewers noted. the palmer house is over 130 years old. rooms have older woodwork and classic furniture; i think that lends to the ambience of the place. it is expensive, and i'm not sure i'd stay there if my company weren't picking up the tab. but the hotel itself is still awe-inspiring.
truthful	""" barely average hotel at premium price"" this hotel has a beautiful lobby but fails to fails to maintain its standards beyond the lobby. i have stayed in the conrad in dublin, ireland and in hongkong both of which i loved. i was looking forward to staying at this hotel. i was extremely disappointed. i am very surprised that this hotel is allowed to carry the conrad name. pros: elegant lobby nicely decorated with fresh flowers location: located in the heart of chicago disappointments - stained and worn out carpet in hallway - room was small - phone and lightbulb in room were broken - breakfast was $60 for two people, service was slow and impolite - hotel rationed soaps and shampoo, one bar of soap to share and one bottle of shampoo which was not replaced for two days, i felt like i was staying at a budget hotel. and to cap off my stay the hotel made a billing error which took three months and more effort than it was worth to correct. i would not stay at this hotel again, it just is not worth the premium price they charge."
deceptive	we just got back from a trip to chicago for my 30th birthday and we could not have been more impressed by this hotel! service was excellent, especially the maid service. our room was so clean and fresh towels brought in daily. the front desk staff was some of the most professional and friendly staff i have ever dealt with while travling. the location is excellent as it is within walking distance of the best restaurants and stores. i highly recommend affinia for a the perfect family vacation.
deceptive	this is an absolutely gorgeous hotel. we had an amazing view of the city, especially at night. our room was luxurious with extremely comfortable beds. there was a desk and chair, large bathroom, comfortable chair and reading lamp. there was also an area for snacks and a coffee maker, that included starbucks coffee. we would definitely come back again!
truthful	we stayed in the ic chicago for 6 nights from 26th dec after reading the reviews on trip advisor. we werent disappointed. we had 2 rooms opposite each other in the historic tower. the rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building. we got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the wifi at $17 per day. as the hotel is on the magnificent mile there are plenty of place to eat including for breakfast. the starbucks in the lobby was a hit with the kids - very handy. i would definitely recommend the hotel.
deceptive	"the palmer house hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence. the rooms are beautifully decorated, with class and superior quality furniture. the hotels restaurant ""lockwood"" consist's of delicious french and italian cuisine. the location is in the prime area to downtown, and shopping areas. this hotel is suited for pristine guests, and those who are not willing to settle for less. if you're looking for not just any stay, but a stay in luxury, you should give the palmer house hilton a try. it is one of the best of the best in chicago, and your stay will be one to remember."
deceptive	warning! my stay at the talbott hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels. i was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends. after receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the talbott. they were promoting up to $30 breakfast credit per day. and breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time. upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee (which we wouldn't have known had he not told us) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group. once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to king suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved. if someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms i would have sworn we were at motel 6, not a luxury hotel in chicago. the linens were stained, room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee. i was truly disgusted. after a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep. the next morning i was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests. i have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts i have ever eaten. the toast was stale, eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs, and the juice they served was sour. i would never recommend this as a place to stay. i would suggest the red roof inn over this place anytime.
deceptive	we booked an american girl place package at fairmont chicago millennium park. told that we'd have a room with a nice view, apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building! ended up getting a smoking room when we booked non-smoking, cost us $100 more a night than we were told, and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant. would never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever!
truthful	rooms are so dark we had to insist they bring lamps so we could see. the room we had at almost $400 a night was dingy and small. don't mistakingly think the hard rock cafe is there, it isn't. they have a chinese restaurant that is overpriced and limited on items. the room service menu is broken down in terms of times you can order certain foods. when my wife wanted a milk shake we had to call the manager to have it made since the kitchen staff said it wasn't a choice. the rolled roast beef sandwich was listed under the 2 am choice and they refused to make it untill again, we called the manager who did get it to us. the staff did appear friendly, although housekeeping totally disregarded our 'do not disturb' sign and would call us on the phone. don't make the mistake of staying here but if you do, walk across the street and buy snacks you want because even a soda is $3 plus 19% gratuity. we ended up having to order delivery food brought to us. this is the most overpriced, over rated and dingy hotel we've ever stayed in. taxi to airport is $40.
deceptive	we just returned from a relaxing stay at the intercontinental in chicago. i have to say the service was phenomenal! from the maid to the concierge and everyone in between, the staff treated us like royalty. it was quite the treat to feel so special. our room was gorgeous. the view of the city was breathtaking. the luxury mattress and bedding made for the most comfortable peaceful slumber. we found the marble bathroom stunning and impeccably clean. my wife was very pleased with the lighted make-up mirror while i enjoyed the reliable wi-fi connection. during our stay we dinned in the zest. wow! they offer an extensive wine menu and a full array of gourmet food options. we had to try the famous wiener schnitzel -- it was scrumptious. afterwards, my wife and i shared the chocolate lava cake, can i just say oh that cake is to die for! really the best we ever had. in the morning we spent some time working off dinner at the junior olympic swimming pool; followed by an exhilarating round of cardio in the hotels dedicated cardio room. afterwards, a trip to the sauna was a well deserved refuge. overall, our stay at the intercontinental in chicago was nothing short of fabulous. this luxury hotel is complete with the finest of amenities and the most caring staff. we are looking forward to staying at the intercontinental again, hopeful soon!
truthful	i was in chicago for a convention and stayed at the sheraton towers. i had a negative experience because i got about one dozen very painful bites by bed bugs on my torso. it made attending the conference uncomfortable. the staff changed the sheets but could not move me to another room, as the conference had booked the whole hotel. after the sheets were changed, i got no more bites, thankfully. despite this, i managed to enjoy the stay. i liked the location next to the river, and the fact that it was easy to walk to magnificent mile.
deceptive	having stayed in standard hotels before, when my wife suggested we stay in an upscale hotel for our weekend in chicago i was skeptical to say the least. after staying at the amalfi hotel i may never stay in a regular motel again! right off the bat instead of a 40 foot counter with snooty workers or kids that started two days ago they have individual desks for check in with people that *gasp* have a clue as to what they are doing. we got the steakhouse package deal at the on-site keefer's steakhouse restaurant the food was the highest quality and cooked to perfection. the room was spacious had robes and slippers, a stocked mini-bar, the mattress was comfy, and the whole room was clean. the staff was amazing and had no problems bringing extra towels and pillows for my wife. in the morning the continental breakfast was served on each floor instead of herding into the lobby which i loved cause i love breakfast but not crowds. unfortunately for me the hotel was close to a lot of shopping, my wife was in heaven however, and we spent a large portion of the day on the magnificent mile attempting to max out my credit cards. the whole trip i believe was made special by the atmosphere of the hotel and its staff i would recommend the amalfi to anyone visiting chicago.
truthful	in the 100 degree heat of a chicago summer, it sucks if your air conditioner does not work. after 2 maintenance men attempted to rectify the issue i was offered a portable fan which on low speed sound as if a helicopter was hoovering over my room. i requested a room change and a not so polite, unsympathetic night front desk attendant stated that was not possible because the hotel was at capacity. maybe a manager could help me in the morning. the next day went by and no call was received. at 7pm, i called the front desk. no one was aware of my problem. approximately 45 minutes later, a manager returned my call and stated a double room was available. i accepted it was glee. anything was better than a room that does not cool below 78 degrees in the middle of summer. i was paritally correct. the bathroom door of the new room did not close. thank god my boyfriend and i are past the shy part of the relationship. as for room 1618, i believe i was not the first guest to complain about the air conditioner. what's unfortunate is they continued to place guests into this room. and did not offer any reufunds or perks for my sleepless night in the sauna! this hotel need a major overhaul!!
deceptive	"i was initially excited when i found out that my employer was sending me to chicago on business, but i could never have imagined the frustration and irritation that would be heaped on me by the inept staff of the james chicago. when i arrived, my reservation could not be found in their system, although i had made it myself. after some words with the manager on duty, mr. chad montgomery, i was given a room at the previously agreed upon rate. anyone can make a mistake, so i wasn't too angry at that point. my room was bland and colorless, in spite of the james' boasts of their attention to design and detail. the room was mostly clean, but after seeing the stains on the bedding, i am not convinced that they were washed after the room's last occupant. i attended a stressful business meeting in the dining room that night, complete with cold and undercooked food served by sloppy, disgruntled waitstaff. afterward i decided that a relaxing spa treatment was in order. i was assured that i would enjoy ""asha's purifying shower ritual"", which would primarily take place in my own room. the shower was okay, but i think i must be allergic to the jojoba oil provided, because i broke out in hives all over my body. next came the ""in-room"" portion. while i was in the shower, five of the foulest smelling candles had been lit in my room. i guess they were supposed to make it smell good, but i began choking on the odor the minute i walked in the room. my masseuse directed me to lie on the bed for the next portion, but his hands wandered a little too much for my liking. i am sure certain areas are not on the massage menu. in closing, if you have ever considered staying at the james chicago, i beg of you to reconsider. with only a handful of positive things to say about the hotel, and a suitcase full of negative (including a pending court case against the masseuse), i can almost guarantee you would regret staying there. i know i do."
deceptive	amalfi hotel chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time. its proximity to some of the best spots in chicago makes it a visitor's delight. it is close to the magnificient mile which is the shopping area, it is also close to the loop, merchandise mart and michigan avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space. each guest room includes a flat screen hd tv. the beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast. the 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business.the hotel has a no-smoking policy. it also has free internet facilities, room service, air conditioning, laundry/drycleaning, multilingual staff to make communication easy, spa services, heating, conference facilities, satelite tv, brailed elevators and pets are allowed. the concierge desk offer the best wine available and i must add that the wine is great. the hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty. the staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand. the hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean. the hotel makes it possible for you to relax, go shopping in the best stores which are close-by, eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership. they offer great deals for every type of customer. i would definitely recommend this place.
deceptive	"i stayed here last august and i'm truly glad that i will never have to stay here again. the website does a great job of creating an illusion. the rooms are so much smaller than it seems on the website. i thought the monaco was walking distance to a few nightclubs but it isnt. the wireless internet is free but it is extremely slow. for such a ""classy"" hotel, there isnt a pool. at $46 per night, the on-site parking is way too expensive for guests. all and all, i would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
deceptive	the staff at the james chicago hotel seemed determined to make my stay a horrible one. when i entered the establishment to check in, i was ignored. the clerk let half a dozen people in front of me before she even acknowledged me. thinking room service would be better, i relaxed in my room while i waited for my food. by the time it reached my room, it was cold and the wrong order. disgusted, i went down to the pool only to find it was closed for maintenance. all the restaurants the hotel recommended were one-star, and none of my regular channels were on the tv. all in all, it was a bad stay at the james hotel in chicago.
truthful	we stayed 2 nights at the knickerbocker and could not have had a better stay. the hotel has recently renovated there rooms. the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful from dave and cora at the martini bar to julie at the front desk who help out with an upgrade for us. the hotel has everything you need for your stay and is close to all the fun that chicago offers. our pick for the city is the knickerbocker. john and judy.
truthful	we ate at the prime house restaurant last year, that is why we picked the hotel. last year the food and service at the prime house was outstanding. this year the service felt rushed. the waitress even asked why we were eating so early. it was 6:30pm. our room in the hotel felt cramped. the beds were comfortable. the bathroom had maintenance problems. the maid service and turndown out night was good. all of the staff at the hotel were friendly and helpful. i just was not impressed by the quality of the hotel itself for what we were paying.
deceptive	"i recently stayed in the james hotel in chicago and trust me i will never do it again. when you pay a premium price you'd expect first rate service. our whole experience was a disaster though short lived b/c we could stay their another second. when we arrived at the hotel we had to wait while the receptionist finished playing with her phone for service and then our room was not ready. so we had to wait in the lobby with our baggage. when we finally got to the room i wouldn't exactly call it clean but it wasn't to bad. the pictures on the website are nice enough but the furniture is falling apart and probably from walmart. there was plenty of space for an average person of 5' but i'm 6'4"" and the beds where smaller than what they said, not to mention uncomfortable. we ordered room service and not only did they bring us the wrong order but it took 2 hours. there walls were also paper thin so we got little sleep. the heater helped block out some noise until it stopped working in the middle of the night. so the next morning, sore from the uncomfortable bed, hungry tired and cold we checked out before we even had our coffee. stay away!"
truthful	"i got a sunday night stay for only $50 off of priceline.com, so it would be hard to complain...but this was truly a great hotel, even if i paid double. the first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the hyatt regency chicago is wow. the lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant, plenty of couches,seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains. you take the escalator to the concierge/directory/check in area. the hotel let me check in at 12pm (i had a 3pm check in time). i suggest you call ahead like i did so they know you are coming early.the women at the desk was friendly and when i requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me ""i have a room on the 18th floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view"". i thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that i wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall. the rooms are big (i had a doubles room) the beds were beautiful with great pillows,blankets,headboards etc. an ipod alarm clock was a nice 21st century touch to the room. great to plug in your ipod, listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring chicago. the view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries. another great feature is the concierge area's computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport. you simply look at the screen, click on your airline icon and following the instructions. i had my boarding passes in about a minute. came in handy when i got to ohare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers. i was only in the hotel for 1 day, but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences i have had and i travel alot. it is a business hotel, but definitely a great choice for families and couples. definitely would stay here again when im passing through chicago."
deceptive	the millennium knickerbocker hotel has seen better days. i had fond memories of staying there when it was considered the finest hotel. i booked a room to celebrate a special occasion and found a highly-priced, not so great property. i had to look at five suites before i found one where the upholstered furniture was to my liking, some of the other rooms carpet was not clean, the refrigerator was dripping water, and the balcony was littered with cigarette butts. i finally settled for a room, only because the bellman was friendly and apologetic but as over priced as it was i should have turned around and walked out. i sent a letter to the management when i returned home, but it had been a month and i never received an answer. there are plenty of other places to spend your money. don't leave it at this hotel.
truthful	check ins went smoothly. but be advised.... walls are super thin, the building is old and the rooms are very very very small. the downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out. for the price it wasn't bad. it was walking distance to most major attractions. overall ... it's ok at best. another plus is the cta is close by.
deceptive	"when i went to the james hotel in chicago i truly expected a luxury experience exactly like what they were advertising. gorgeous chairs, staff at the desk focusing on their job, and a clean, well decorated hotel room. much to my, and my wallet's dismay i found quite the opposite. i arrived to the hotel late after my flight was delayed, and found the clerk reading a magazine. it must have been a fascinating article, as it took him a full minute to look up and ask if i had a reservation, or would be making one. i said i had one, and gave him the voucher i'd printed out. he checked it, and said that all the single rooms had already been rented out, he went on to say that i would have to pay extra for a two or three person room if i wished to stay the night. i grudgingly accepted the two person option as the jet lag was setting in and i desperately needed to get some sleep. the clerk offered to walk me to my room, saying i looked tired and trying to navigate the hotel would be much easier after i got some sleep. i accepted, and followed him to my new room. he carried the briefcase i had with me, but it was not apparent why at the time as i had both hands free. he ushered me into my room, setting the briefcase down inside, and said if i needed anything that the phone next to the bed would give me a direct line to room service without having to dial anything. i thanked him and closed the door. it was then that i looked around and fully saw where i was staying. what was supposedly a two person suite was two twin beds 6"" apart, covered in ruffled blankets and sheets. the cleaning staff had obviously not been in here recently. a quick look around the other areas and i found the bathroom was out of toilet paper and soap, not even the complementary ones were left behind. i got ready for bed, and looked around for the tv remote, which it turned out, had no batteries in it. instead, i just turned out the lights and rolled over, sheets and blanket turned inside out to try and find a cleaner option. in the morning i walked down to the lobby and asked to check out. i'd had enough of the hotel after one night. the clerk that morning was a cheerful blond who cheerfully asked me my room number and handed me a bill. $240 for my room, and an extra $80 with a note about a baggage service. i asked her about it, and she said if anyone carried my bags to my room for me it was filed under the baggage service. i asked if it was considered reasonable to charge $80 for carrying a suitcase to a room two floors up, and riding the elevator, and she said it was unusual, but not unheard of. she offered to change it to a ""mere"" $20 and handed me a slip with a phone number, name, and reason for the disagreement, saying that the manager would handle any complaints between the clerk and i after i signed it. i did so, and left, my wallet $260 lighter, and my head throbbing with a headache from lack of sleep."
deceptive	the homewood suites is one of my favorite hotels in chicago! it is a great place to stay as a family. the last time my family and i visited chicago, we stayed and picked the shedd aquarium package. what an amazing time! the aquarium is great, and we saved a lot of money by buying this package. i also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen. with two really picky children, it was so nice to be able to cook, or at least to have the option. we also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the homewood suites chicago downtown. nice pool, great workout room, breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening. i wouldn't stay anywhere else when i visit the windy city!
deceptive	i recently had the misfortune of staying at the swissotel chicago hotel in illinois, and it was one of the worse travel experiences i have ever had! first off the shuttle that was suppose to pick us up at the air port was late by over an hour! then when the bus finally came, the driver was nice enough but it was clearly his first day on the job since he got lost going back to the hotel. finally when we got to the hotel they didn;t seem to have our reservation for the 2nd room. (my wife and i stay in one room, our teenage girls usually stay in their own room.) so after the very rude clerk at the corner did nothing to help us we were forced to pack into one room. we would have rented another room but they had no vacancies left. they hotel did have a large occupancy rate, but that only slowed up everything else. our room service was late almost everytime we ordered, and the hotel restaurant never had a wait less then 45 mins. the quality of the room was fair enough, but it was almost impossible to get room service, we could not get fresh towels for almost 2 days! we were suppose to stay for a week, we left after 4 days and found a different hotel to stay at. i would not recommend this place to anyone! stay away!
truthful	will start by saying the employees were wonderful, especially in the restaurant / bar employees, could not have been nicer.....what appeared to be the hotel manager went above and beyond....unfortunately, that's where it ends! the rooms, in my opinion, appeared different then pictures and were worn and ratty...you know, uninviting sofa and crappy coffee table and desk area... the first room i was given had bright construction lights shining in my room and men working on the next building that were looking directly into my window!!i kid you not; they seemed as if they were about 15-20 ft from my window!! and this was after i specifically had asked for a room that might have a decent view..i was then switched to a room that had virtually no light and was truly, again... just worn out!!!not a 4 star hotel, this seemed to be closer to a 2, perhaps being extremely kind 3 star...i travel on business so i know the difference...i merely touched the cabinet door on the bar unit and it literally fell off in my hand! i complained to a very nice woman from housekeeping and to her credit, she made sure the door was fixed asap. they gave me a bottle of wine to compensate..which i utilized to dull my senses as to my surroundings for the next 2 days....i wanted to give omni a shot...big mistake... unfortunately, brought a friend with me to show her how great chicago was and i was soooo embarrassed, as i had chosen the hotel...she was extremely disappointed as well...should have gone with my first instinct which was the conrad!! lesson learned!
deceptive	did not enjoy my stay at the omni chicago hotel. firstly, the man at the front desk was extremely unhelpful. there was a problem with the reservation and he gave me and my family a lot of hassle. secondly when we finally got the reservation sorted out, the air conditioning unit in our room would not go below 75 degrees. considering i paid well over $250 per night for the romance package reservation, it was below my standards and i will not be heading back to the omni chicago hotel any time soon.
truthful	we just returned from a girls shopping /sight-seeing trip.the palmer house was like home away from home.the hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any inconveniences or hear any noise from the work.the lobby was breathtaking, all dressed up for christmas.the staff from check-in to housekeeping was very welcoming and friendly.our room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal space.i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.chicago is a great town.
deceptive	my wife and i decided to stay at the amalfi while we visited friends in chicago; we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this 'luxury' hotel to any of our friends. amalfi claims that your stay begins with a 'warm greeting,' but we received the exact opposite. the front desk clerk was rude, sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question, and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room. apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog, who we had to bring at the last minute. the room on the pet floor was alright, nothing spectacular, and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered-up dog urine. we proceeded to dinner at keefer's restaurant and had to wait an additional 45 minutes past our reservation time. i have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire; opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant. the next day, i could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly, and had to finish some work at our friend's house. my wife had called for some extra towels and pillows, which took about half an hour to receive. she also ordered breakfast because breakfast in bed was her favorite- until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them. we were set to stay for 3 days, but only managed to stay 2. we will not be staying here again.
truthful	we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on hotwire over labor day weekend. we arrived at the hard rock at around 10:00 a.m., and they were able to give us our rooms early. hooray! we were on the 5th floor (beatles theme). the rooms were very comfortable. one of our rooms was on a corner, and had lots of windows. the other was was a bit larger with fewer windows. not a great view from our side of the hotel, but we didn't pay for a room with a view. the beds and pillows were extremely comfortable, the bathroom was full of aveda products, and there was a bathrobe in the closet. the tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice, but we weren't in the room a lot to use it. we were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we'd be charged. no problems there. we did not make use of the free fitness center, because the weather was perfect. my husband was able to go for a run through grant park along the waterfront instead. he said it was wonderful. we did use the free internet in our rooms. it was 'wired' internet, but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway. the room was a bit dim at night, but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps. there was virtually no hall / elevator noise. the location of the hard rock is ideal. it is easy to get breakfast at the corner bakery, just blocks to either grant park, the art institute, state street shopping, or michigan ave. to sum up, there was absolutely nothing to complain about. we would be glad to stay here again any time.
deceptive	my experience at the ambassador east hotel was truly terrible. i went to chicago with my husband and children to attend a wedding. this hotel was recommended by the wedding party. it was a terrible choice. despite the special discount we got because of the wedding, the hotel turned out to be very expensive compared to other nearby hotels. the staff and amenities were also very unfriendly to children. my kids were absolutely terrified of several members of the staff who scowled at them and yelled at them for no reason. the place was also very formal and stiff and decorated with a lot of breakable and expensive items. my son narrowly avoided breaking a vase when an ill tempered bellhop nearly ran him down with a luggage cart. overall, i would say i was very displeased with the staff, the hotel's attitude towards children, and the expense of the hotel. on the plus side, our window had an excellent view of the city. still, i would not return here again.
deceptive	the entrance and room was spacious and modern, yet elegant. it was very easy to get around to many places because it is in the middle of all the action of chicago. the drinks were very exotic and tickled the taste buds. indeed, it is one of the best vacation or weekend getaway spots.
deceptive	everything you would would expect from a top-notch hotel and exceeded by the service. the trendy decor and easy to access dining gave us a 'second-wind' pick up after a day of sight-seeing. this hotel is definitely the place that i want to come back to. by the time we left after 4 days and 3 nights, my wife and i wished we had more time to enjoy the restaurant a few more times and the delightful swiss flare. one of the things we enjoyed the most was seeing the water from our window. the feeling of being pampered can only come from the very gracious hotel staff and this hotel is number 1 in my mind.
truthful	my boyfriend and i decided to stay at the conrad chicago for our anniversary. the second we walked in, we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room. white luxurous bedding on the king bed, plasma t.v./ subroofer/ surround sound speakers (my boyfriend was more impressed than me, as i reminded him that we didn't come to chicago for the hotel room) very large bathroom w/ tub and separate stand-in shower, granite countertops, his/ her robes and slippers. the view wasn't great, but we were on the 6th floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us. not a large room by any means, but again . . . we didn't go to the city for the hotel room. it was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room. we got a great rate on it ($140 at hotels.com) but i think the going rate is usually closer to mid $200's. i've stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one. we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city.
truthful	this hotel has the worst rooms we have stayed in during the last 10 years. the first room they gave us was a shock. tiny and the bathroom was a joke,, you had to step inside, move out of the way just to shut the door. the furniture is disgusting and all the wood trim was very beat up and painted over about 100 times. so they transfered us to the 'executive suite' that room had a tiny bathroom.. i mean tiny! the furniture was hideous and dirty. it was on the 3rd level so you heard every conversation on the street below and traffic was loud. the only impressive part is the lobby.. but don't be fooled. because after that .. the floors above look like they need a major overhaul.. and the rooms were not worth even $100 per night. we stayed there a year ago because we got stuck through priceline deal. i don't think we want to do priceline again only because they have the knickerbocker as a 4 star hotel and we don't ever want to go back there again. 2 stars at best for the dumpy knickerbocker. they should be ashamed of themselves for even allowing guests to stay in those rooms. boomer. naperville, il
deceptive	a few weeks ago we stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago. the hotel was a bust from the get go. as we arrived in the lobby, we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up. (we could hear her talking in the back for 5 minutes.) when she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful. we had to wander around the halls looking for our room. once we got to our room, we thought the weekend was going to get better. the rooms are modern and nicely designed. that was about all that this hotel had going for it though. as soon as we started to explore the room more, it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before. the bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it. we called a worker and they cleaned most of it up, but the thought of it still remained. as we all settled down to sleep, there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door. after about an hour, we finally made a call to the front desk to complain. the woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in chicago. they were staying there the next 2 nights. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone! it's a hard rock hotel all right. (at least that's what the beds feel like!)
truthful	staff were friendly, room was well kept like a typical hyatt location. hotel is huge, with two buildings and over 2000 rooms. good location, close to michigan ave and the subway. parking is $48/day. ouch! i bid on it on priceline for $59.
deceptive	the ambassador east hotel, located in downtown chicago, is one of the best hotels i've ever stayed in. my wife and i went into the city on a weekend getaway and found the ambassador east on a hotel booking website. their rates are very, very reasonable for the high class and luxury that they provide. i was pleased to know that they allow pets as we decided to go into the city last minute and couldn't find anyone to watch our dog for the weekend. i was more than pleased with the friendly staff and felt like their hotel put an extra emphasis on knowing their customer, which is nice because most places in chicago are very impersonal. all in all i was very pleased with our stay and would recommend it to anyone looking for a place to stay in the downtown area. 5/5 stars.
truthful	"my husband and i made a reservation for 2sure nights but decided to stay just the second night. i called the hotel and spoke with eric, he quickly canceled my reservation and i asked if we would be charged for thd cancellation, he said no and that was the end of it. my husband then remembered we needed to cancel from bookit.com as well. i called and they said the hotel wouldnt authorize a cancellation per the terms and agreement. i informed courtney from bookit.com that i specifically asked if we would be charged and i was told no by eric. she spoke with the mgr erica and she said erica would honor that if i could provide a name. i got his name and callex back and he told the bookit consultant that he ""didnt recall"" saying that. i was so furious that i called him on 3the way with the bookit consultant and he just lied!!!!!!!!!!! he said, no ma'am i dont remember saying that. i said so since you dont remember thats it??? i said my husband heard him say it b/c he was on speaker phone since we were driving on the way there. i asked to speak to erica, told her the situation and she said she cant go off of heresay and couldnt honor what her employee screwed up on. i asked him nicely to please tell the truth and he just would not tell thr truth. i have never writte. a review for a hotel before but i am going to go out of my way to make sure corporate sees this. erica was very unprofessional and cared more about not taking sides than she did about making sure the guests feel welcome. very disappointed!! will never stay again!!"
deceptive	recently stayed at the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile and was a little underwhelmed. it's convenient location did not compensate for the fact that the property is very old and definitely in need of some updating and renovating. there is a definite need for some noise control -- everything and everybody could be heard from inside the room. hearing the plumbing from other guests' rooms was particularly annoying. the fitness facilities are really hyped but unfortunately they were not free to use (at least it wasn't included with my booking choice). parking was pretty expensive so if you really don't need it, don't use it. overall, just dissappointed that the great location wasn't matched with great accommodations.
deceptive	"this will be the only hotel i will never forget in my life. hotel monaco chicago has the best staff and also the rooms are also nice. whether if it's a king delux room or a tranquility suite, all of the rooms are luxorious and are themed based, so it suits ones personality. even if you are a super sized person, like me with a height of 6""4', there are special ""tall rooms"" just for you. my days went very fast when i stayed there becuase there was so much to do there. in the mornings i would do yoga from the yoga channel. then i would go downstairs and drink one of their complimentary coffees while reading the morning newspaper. before i go to a meeting, i would get my shoes shined by their complimentary shoeshine service. after i come back from the meeting, i would go to their fitness rooms and workout on their fully-equipped machines. i just didn't want to leave that hotel; so i decided that the next time i come to chicago, i will surely stay at hotel monaco chicago."
truthful	stayed here for 5 nights while visiting chicago for the first time. the location is great, the hotel has been recently renovated and our room was very spacious with two bathrooms. the lobby is a great place to chill and have a drink. didn't eat in the restaurant but there are a few good ones nearby and we were beside the art institute, cultural centre & macys. staff were friendly. would recommend it as a base to tour the city.
truthful	i stayed at the chicago fairmont for four nights for a conference. my fiance' accompanied me. when we checked in, we were given a room with two full size beds despite the fact that our reservation was for one king size bed. so instead of relaxing on the large luxurious bed we had imagined, we were forced to either sleep in separate beds like ward and june cleaver or either cuddle up on a small full size like two college kids in a fraternity house! we discovered that the coffee maker wasn't working and called down to the desk to have someone look at it, and waited two and half hours. we had issues with the plumbing, including extremely slow hot water tap in the bathtub which took 45 minutes to fill. the toilet stopped working twice. we returned one afternoon from the art museum to find the maid in our room, sitting on the bed, watching the tv and talking on her cell phone. they bellman were rude, and wouldn't let my fiance unload our own car which was packed with some of his very expensive camera equipment. there were errors on our bill. last but not least, we saw a roach in the drawers. alive. the restaurant downstairs was decent, and the location is fairly good since my conference was in the hyatt next door but for the price you can find someplace better. i will never ever stay here again under any circumstances.
deceptive	i absolutely loved staying at the swissotel chicago. the entire hotel has such an elegant and luxurious feel to it. the room was absolutely stunning! first of all, it was so spotless and clean. the design of it was beautiful! there was gorgeous artwork on the walls even. the design was very modern and above average for hotel decor. there was a separate bath and separate shower which i loved! there was a huge lcd flat screen tv and high speed wireless internet available. there was even an ipod docking station which was great for listening to music and so convenient since i brought my ipod with me! the view from the window of chicago was beautiful too. the service was very quick and everyone was very friendly. i didn't have any problems at all but if i did i'm sure the customer service at the hotel would have had it fixed very quick i could tell their top priority was the guests happiness and satisfaction! there were even two restaurants in the hotel and a lounge! i can't wait to go back to this hotel. it felt like i was on a luxurious vacation!
deceptive	"i went to stay in the millenium hotel chicago. now, first, being from rural midwest i was surprised at the price in general, but kind of accepted it when i was assured by my cousin(whom i was visiting in chicago) said it was normal. so i check in, service seems fine. i get checked in, room seems ok. a couple of hours later, a lady comes into my room, not a hotel employee, just some lady. turns out, they cross checked the rooms. we(her and i) went down and complained. turns out they double booked the room, not that they were full, but they were full on that room type, standard, as well as the superior rooms. rather than simply upgrade one of us for the mistake they asked which one of us would like to ""move up"". we argued with them for 20 minutes, they didn't budge, our only option was for one of us to fork over an extra $60 for a corner superior. we(the lady, her name was sharon) decided to split the difference some, she gave me $20 and i moved. i get to the new room about 20 minutes later, nobody, but sharon helped me move. i get there, the bed was thrown together, not made, and the bathroom wasn't clean, the garbage had a kleenex in it(i wasn't going to check if it was used). i called down, it was now 5pm. no answer, i called for 10 minutes and finally got a hold of someone. i told them about the state of my room. they said they would have someone up ""right away"". i waited 30 minutes and a lady comes in, not in uniform, but she did a hell of a job cleaning. she switched out the garbage, wiped out the whole bathroom, vaccuumed around me, and switched out the bedding, all told she was in and out in 10 minutes. she didn't say two words to me, but she did clean. i stayed the night and checked out a 7am and will never go back. ryan from iowa"
deceptive	i had really high hopes for this hotel. the location seemed great and the prices were too. unfortunatley, you get what you pay for. despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier, there weren't many other redeeming qualities. the staff was very rude. we arrived late after a long drive from detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in. once we finally got checked in, our room hadn't been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people. we were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldn't get to it until morning! we had planned on seeing some of chicago's attractions like the field museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go. their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them. finally, when we checked out, they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night. ridiculous!
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel, particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv's. the windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room, before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows, which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom. an in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay. there's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince. however, the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use, as well as the whirlpool, jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool. sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks. a nice aspect that isn't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel. the omni chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation, particularly when you don't want to be separated from your pet, within the area.
truthful	i stayed at the fairmont for a few nights and found the whole experience excellent. i was given a very large room with great views of the city; the breakfast was extremely good; and the location was as central as i could have wished for. the pool was not large but felt luxurious and was great for early morning swims. in the evening i spent some time in the hotel bar with friends and that was excellent too. highly recommended as a base for exploring chicago.
truthful	it has been a couple of years since i stayed here, and got it for a night last weekend on hotwire. i paid only $100 and stayed a saturday night. i was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel. the lobby has always been great, but the rooms were a little shabby in the past. not any more, as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years. the location is still amazing, and with the berghoff open again, there is a great restaurant within walking distance.
deceptive	-review of the hard rock hotel- i find that the hard rock hotel, located in chicago, has extrodinary scenary. the hotel is extremely clean with shining furniture and the rooms are breathtaking. hungry? visit this hotel for yourself to see what excellence they provide at the dinner tables. the hotel also host events such as ballet, fun in the bar and a dj to name a few. this hotel is definitely worth your while. i will most definitely visit again. book your reservation as soon as possible and don't forget your camera!
deceptive	my husband and i made a reservation at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers, for a much needed weekend getaway. we took off work early friday to beat traffic. once at the hotel we quickly found out that there was not ample parking. we drove around several times looking for a space and had to park in an adjoining lot and walk across a busy side street to gain access to the hotel. upon checking in we were informed that the floor, where our room was located, was in the process of having the carpets cleaned. we decided since we prepaid with our credit card that we were going to make the best of the situation. we took the elevator, which smelled like urine, up to our room. we did see some carpet cleaning machines, unattended, in the hallway. i hoped for the sake of safety, no children were staying on this floor. we walked into our room and my first thought was how much humidity was in the room and it seems one of the guest used the microwave to heat up some sort of spicy curry cusine. the overwhelming scent of burnt curry mixed with the chemical smell of the carpet shampoo were too much for us. we called the desk manager and asked if we could change rooms. he rudely informed us that the hotel was completely booked due to several weddings. just then, the roar of the carpet cleaning machine came through the walls and i could not hear anything else my husband said. we decided to get a refund on our card and leave the hotel. it was an awful experience.
deceptive	my stay at the homewood suites in downtown chicago was without a doubt one of the worst hotel experiences in my live. i was there for a week long conference. although my reservations had been made months in advance, they did not have a suite for me when i arrived, resulting in having to stay in another hotel for the first night. once my room was ready, i was disappointed by the cleanliness and the limitation of the kitchen: barely large enough to move around, and very few utensils to cook with. the pool was only open for limited hours, and i should not have bothered bringing a swimsuit. at night i was kept awake by the noise coming from adjacent rooms and the traffic outside. my overall experience was a stay in an overpriced suite. i will not book here ever again.
deceptive	my husband and i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for three nights last month. we were celebrating our anniversary, so we decided to splurge on the prestige suite. according to the website, we were to be given either a city or park view, neither of which we had. instead, our room was overlooking a dirty field with some sparse trees. the woman who checked us into our room was rude and impatient, and the man who helped with our bags was the same. when we got to the room, the beds were unkempt and the floors were in serious need of a vacuuming. the bathroom was dirty and there was dried toothpaste in the sink. my husband requested that we be given another room, preferably a clean one, but the clerk told us that there were no other rooms available. if given the chance, i would not stay at this hotel again, even if i were offered a free night.
deceptive	hard rock hotel is a must to visit. no matter what city your in hard rock hotel is the place to stay. filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining. this hotel is the place to be. great views in every location, especially chicago. the service is incredible along with the food and decor. the hotel staff will help you feel right at home, no better than home :)
deceptive	i chose to stay at the 'millennium knickerbocker hotel' during a recent trip to chicago because i had heard they had good reviews. boy, were these reviews wrong!! i had terrible service from the moment i walked in the doors. i was not greeted by the receptionist, it was like i wasn't even there. my room was not ready for me when i got there, even though i got there after my required check-in time, then once i was allowed to go to my room, it was filthy! it was as if they didn't even clean it, so i don't know what the hold up was. there were no towels, shampoo or soap in the bathroom. the worst part was that there were bugs in the tub! the place was the most disgusting place i've ever been to, and it is supposed to be one of the nicest! it should be the nicest for the price they charge. i do not recommend staying here! stay at your own risk!!
deceptive	this is a review of a first class hotel the intercontinental chicago. it's located on chicago's famous magnificent mile near restaurants, shopping, entertainment, and historic landmarks. the service at the hotel is first class and the accommodations are unbeatable. the hotel also features really fabulous amenities including a nice indoor swimming pool, fine dining, a 24 hour business center, and valet parking. this is a extra ordinary luxury hotel that will make your stay in chicago a joy. they offer a number of options on the rate and have a selection of package deals available. visit their website for a photo gallery and a virtual tour.
truthful	i have been 4 times in chicago, and i have stayed in 4 different hotels: this has been for much the very best option. the lobby, the warm of the receptionist, the room, the hotel is very good. it is walking distance to the magnificent mile and there's no chance for you to get lost from this hotel. if you like to travel with style this could be a very good option.
deceptive	the affinia hotel is beautiful! it's in a great location, the service is top-notch, and the rooms are very comfortable and spacious. the look of the hotel is very modern, but it feels warm and cozy, too. the restaurant is amazing! i thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would definitely go back! if you're planning a trip to chicago, check this place out!
truthful	"i am usually a big fan of kimpton hotels, but this place is awful !!! i would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. it is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more ""botique"" . the carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! the bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. when we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. we woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. we told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. the elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. i did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. what a disappointment :("
deceptive	i had to write this review! my tired body walked through the doors of the fairmont. it felt like i walked through heaven's gates, the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly, that i was instantly energized. the front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room. they were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa..oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible, i took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit (my very first) as well as a massage. i was amazed at the size of the meeting/conference room that we used for an afternoon. the room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home. the food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as i was after the meeting, instead of room service, i went in,and the food was mouth watering delicious, and the wait staff was very hospitable they take great pride in everything, even the wake up call was friendly. my stay was so great, that i want to go back again soon!
deceptive	i went here with the family, including our dog marley(they are very pet friendly). we really enjoyed it. this place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment. it also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event. i will definately be coming back next time i need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel!
truthful	"the service was reasonably well...they seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily. the location was fine being that it was central to the city but i found out that it was also a tremendous drawback. it was interesting that the survey i took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response ""quiet"". my visit was anything but, mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor, facing the street. i awoke at 4 a.m. and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the l train that sounded as though it was just outside my window. not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting. at check-out when i informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said, "" ah, city noise."""
truthful	stayed here for 3 nights for a bridgestone/firestone convention. no complaints. room was great with a beautiful view. staff was very accommodating. had drinks and appetizers in main bar. fantastic! great location. yes it's a huge hotel as it's used for conventions but that didn't stop it from being a great place.
truthful	the concierge was so helpful. without hesitation they had the best recommendations for restaurants and attractions all turning out to be wonderful. they even gave us business cards for restaurants that did not take reservations so we could obtain preferential or immediate seating's. loved the health club at the back of the hotel. by joining the presidents club, it only cost ten dollars a day to use the facilities. the rooms were large, updated and had views looking out in 3 directions. the coffee maker in the room was exceptional. location is great for getting mostly anywhere. parking is overpriced so we took our cart to the underground millennium garage that was only $25.00 per 24 hours and a few blocks walk from the hotel.
truthful	it's not a bad hotel. it's just so...disappointing. as a diamond member, i expect slightly more than a room with two double beds with no view. i'm not distraught over this, but come on. ditto the continental breakfast in the executive lounge, which has nothing but fattening pastries, bagels and cereal. low-level hampton inns have a free breakfast that puts this to shame. and what's with the lounge not opening until 6:30am? business travelers often need to be gone by 6:30, not sitting down to their meager breakfast. the in-room wifi is a pain to access, and i somehow got stuck with the $19.99 plan even though i selected the basic plan. (don't get me started on how a $89/night hampton inn can offer free wifi and a full-service hilton & towers seemingly can't...). finally, what's with the two bathrooms per one hotel room? it's an unseemly waste of space, especially when the rooms are so meager. and the gold-plated bathroom fixtures scream 1992, not 2009, as does the picture-tube tv (vs. flat panel). overall, this is a huge disappointment over which conrad should be ashamed.
truthful	the room looked like a country club prison cell. flat paint on all walls, doors, trims, not especially clean. a platform bed and a long shelf/desk with an iron chair. no amenities, no homey touches, nothing on the walls. no room service, no gym, no concierge. the air conditioner clunked off and on all night. on the plus side, the bedding was nice and there was a large screen tv. don't waste your money.
truthful	me (taking a cue from david dancer): 'sup? front desk person: yes? me: so, do i have to wait in the elevator line to get up to my room? front desk person: what room are you in? me: **** front desk person: oh. ...i'm afraid so. or, you can take the other elevators and take the fire stairs up to the 10th floor. me: oh? wtf! so, we're staying at this hotel, and there is a bar on the 29th floor, but we have to wait 15 minutes in line to get to our fucking hotel room? get bent! we're paying to stay here, not just drinking in your bar!
truthful	the chicago hyatt regency deceptively alters the cancellation policy by charging the full room rate upon cancellation--ie the room cannot be cancelled. i recently booked over the phone a one night stay directly with the hotel. the reservation specialist mentioned over the phone there was a 72-hour cancellation policy. however, when i tried to cancel the reservation within that timeframe, robert, the reservation supervisor, said that the room could not be cancelled at any time without charging full price for the room. he said that i should refer to the confirmation e-mail that states at the bottom that prepayment is required at time of booking / non-refunable. this clearly was not what was agreed to over the phone. i told him to cancel without being charged. in response, he threatened to cancel and charge me for the full stay. why would someone cancel if they are going to be charged full price? the bottom line is the hotel deceptively changed the terms of the agreement, and robert should go back to customer service school!
truthful	we stayed here in january when it was -20. but even then we enjoyed it so much we could not wait to get back. chicago is a great town to visit and the homewood suites is the place to stay, period. now we stayed from the 9/5/2009 to 9/5/2009 and enjoyed every day. (p.s. the weather was in the high 70s). to get back to the hotel, it was fantastic, it has everything you need and its write in the heart of the city. two seperate rooms were very handy as we had our teenage son. full kitchen, (laundry on 7th floor) seveal foodmarkets within walking distance, everything within walking distance. you wont need a car and at $42 for valet parking you wont want one. dont take my word for it , check it out you wont be disappointed. oh and did i mention free breakfast and dinner . job done. its a no brainer book now. p.s. theres also a beach within walking distance
truthful	my company booked our group for a conference and sales meeting. the service was friendly, helpful and the property was beautiful. the hotel was clean and filled with history. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay and the rate was reasonable as well.
truthful	this was one of the best hotels i've stayed at in chicago. i've also tried amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown. this one was the best. great service, beautiful room, roomy bathroom, top-notch amenities.
truthful	"where do i start. the gm was a nice guy for handling the incident i had. anthony -the concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. he set me up and quoted me a price of $125, when i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. at the end of the massage i gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change, she insisted that i got ""a hotel rate"" because anthony set me up. she called anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay anthony the difference - $45. she then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which i declined. in short - shady dealings with this place. i was quite taken back. the gm selman comp'd me a night but , i felt swindled big time. stay somewhere else. the concierge has something going on..."
truthful	great location - right on the chicago river - away from the other skyscraper hotels - our room was good size, very clean and with a nice river view - overall, a great staff - in particular i would like to point out christy morgan - chief experience officer and paula fortney - concierge for their assistance in making this stay a memorable one - (in the interests of full disclosure, we stayed here on our amex - starwood points)
truthful	i am staying here now and actually am compelled to write this review before i fall asleep. the front desk staff were brief and one of them was chatting with her friend (gossiping) as i checked in (very unprofessional). the room she offered me was on a 'high' floor (5th.... ha) and when i checked in there was a big bag of grapes left behind by the previous guest on the window sill and some of the previous guests hair in the bathtub....i was done. called down and had them re-clean the room; they made no offer to compensate or upgrade...not even a bottle of wine. the front desk clerk suggested i come down and get a key to another room (like i have time for that). disappointing as i do like kimpton hotels and am a kimpton in touch member (btw they've done away with the amenities...you just get a free item from the mini bar).
truthful	"the hard rock hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into chicago.. the location is fantastic - a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as lake michigan, millennium park, and art museum - and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from. my co-works loved the exterior of the building, views from the rooms, the art on the walls, and crisp, clean & hip feeling of the hotel, but not ""too over the top"" for ""business"". by far a better experience than your usual ""chain"" hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms. here you feel special...for the same price. the lobby and bar have fun & cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on michigan ave (or catch a real rock star in the lobby!)"
deceptive	"i stayed at the monaco-chicago back in april. i was in town on business, and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine. having spent a weekend there, i have no idea what my friend was talking about. the complimentary morning coffee was weak; the fitness room was dimly lit; and i thought i'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when i used their supposed ""overnight"" laundry service for a suit i spilled some wine on. my room was adequate, but nowhere near what i've seen elsewhere at this price point. recent renovation must be slang for ""everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive."" the mattress in my room was incredibly firm, and i slept poorly. when i travel, i expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home. at most hotels, i receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations. this was an exception to my usual, and i won't be back anytime soon."
truthful	excellent service! clean and spacious rooms with a great view of downtown chicago. location is excellent for exploring the main sights and the golden mile. great concierge service. pricey though... don't valet if you don't need to.
truthful	i stayed for four nights while attending a conference. the hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to michigan ave shopping or rush st., but just off the busy streets. the room i had was spacious, and very well-appointed. the staff was friendly, and the fitness center, while not huge, was well-equipped and clean. i've stayed at a number of hotels in chicago, and this one is my favorite. internet wasn't free, but at $10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels, and it worked very well.
deceptive	"when my boyfriend and i checked into our room at the omni chicago, we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled, as if kids had been jumping on it. that was just the first of our ""issues"". the glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them, and i saw a (dead-thank goodness!) roach behind the toilet. we were given the hotel night stay by a friend, so we decided to just deal with it. we ordered some munchies from the kitchen, and the chips were stale, and the dip smelled sour. after coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies, we were able to enjoy our stay--but i would not recommend this place to anyone!"
deceptive	i was disappointed in my stay at the james. i am on a strict gluten free diet and was told the hotel restaurant could accomodate my needs. each time i sat down for a meal, i would explain my dietary needs to the waiter. most times, i ended up having to send the plate back because some gluten item was included. my wife has sleep apnea and when we made our reservations, i made sure to ask if there was a room available with an outlet near the bed so that she could plug in her cpap machine. i was assured that this was no problem. however, when we arrived at the hotel, we had to request a room change because there was no outlet near the bed. we had to wait in the lobby for sometime because the room we were moved to was not yet finished benig cleaned. overall, it was not an entirely horrific stay, but i expected more out of a hotel of this supposed caliber. next time i visit chicago, i will be staying at another hotel.
truthful	"the hard rock hotel chicago has become my favorite hotel. i've stayed there at least 5 times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience. as you might have guessed - it has a super rock & roll theme, with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor's elevator lobby. the rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians. you can request being on the floor of your favorite band (like kiss, aerosmith, etc...) the rooms are great. well appointed. super comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows. the large tv has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience. there's a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar. i've always had a room with big windows and a view down michigan ave (the hotel sits right on michigan - a block from the canal). the bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design... some of the showers have windows in side of them (you can shower and enjoy the view down michigan!) or close the waterproof drapes. i've never had anything but a great experience with the staff here... front desk, doorman, etc are all great. there's a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy. big screen tv to catch the latest scores, too. of course, rock & roll music pumps thru the place. you can stay at a ""plain"" hotel anywhere... but this is a great, well designed, fun and memorable hotel that you'll want to return back to. if i had one concern - it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight. my daily car parking rate was close to $50 per night, which i'm sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop. stay here. be cool."
deceptive	from the moment i walked in i was impressed. the staff was very courteous and knowledgeable and the atmosphere was welcoming. the hotel was spacious and glamorous without looking overindulgent. my room was very nice and comfortable with a beautiful view and all everything i would need was in my kitchen. i found the pool and gym to be fantastic and i could truly relax during my stay. i will definitely book another stay at this hotel.
deceptive	"if you are looking for a high end hotel on the magnificent mile, the affinia chicago is not your best option. first of all, the ""central"" location is not so convenient - there is quite a hike to the navy pier (which this hotel claims to be the ""official"" hotel of) and to the shops on the mile. secondly, the hotel is small - only 215 rooms, most of which are miniscule by comparison to the other hotels in the area. thirdly, they have one restaurant and one lounge, both of which offer the same menu which seems a bit bizarre for a high end hotel. finally the affinia has one of the most rude staffs ever witnessed in a luxury hotel. one does expect some courtesy at the outrageous prices but be ready for the attitude and snobbery that will greet you at the affinia!"
deceptive	this hotel is the best hotel ever in my opinion, and i really enjoy everything thing about it and i also have many different reasons why i like this hotel. from the entrance to every details on the inside all the way up to the rooms, everything seems to pocess some kind of style to it and not forgetting such a modern feel it has. i completely am astonished by this building and if i had to pick one to compare with this one i really would go for this one. it's like a person would have to see it to believe. it has a lot of modern designs. thank you and this is my review and it's real.
truthful	as others have said, once all the construction works are completed i suspect that the prices this hotel can (legitimately) charge will put it out of our price range. which will be a pity because it is an excellent hotel, & the location couldn't be better. the room was very spacious, with separate sitting & study areas & a nice bathroom. only 3 minor points: downstairs they were serving a free basic breakfast (coffee & pastries), but we only knew of it on our last morning - nobody had mentioned this; the cost of internet - $9.99 - is a bit dear especially when lots of motels now offer it free; there was only powered milk in the rooms, which wasn't that nice. but none of these really spolied a really enjoyable stay.
deceptive	this was my first time staying at the hard rock hotel in chicago and i have nothing but hate for the entire experience. the building itself is maintained, however the staff is rude and inept to the point of making their customers feel physically ill. and while the outside appearance is fine and dandy, my room 325, was repulsive. as soon as the bellboy threw my luggage onto the room's ground and verbally demanded a tip, i noticed insects of all kinds scurrying around, the room was pungent with what smelled like human excrement, before i could say anything to the bellboy he had taken his tip and fled. immediately i went to the front desk and was made to wait for over a half hour, a complete waste of time, because as soon as i had reported my problem i was told that no other rooms were available and i would have to make do, they did however say i could stay the night free of charge. the next morning as i was set to leave i decided i would try the breakfast, in hopes of finding one redeeming quality. let me tell you, that breakfast tasted like space food with dirt and mold, the worst breakfast i have ever had in my entire life. overall the employees are arrogant and callous, with the work ethic of a 2 year old child, they cannot cook, the room for me was poorly maintained, however they are good at refunding your money.
truthful	this was my first time in chicago and wanted a hotel that was in a good location. this definitely fit the bill. i could walk to all the places i wanted to see - very close to michigan ave and the magnificent mile. about a 15 minute walk to the art institute. the hotel staff was very friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. there was coffee in the lobby every morning, that was very welcome. the room was comfortable and clean and fairly quiet. i could hear the train and some traffic from the street (considering the location, this wasn't bad and didn't affect my ability to sleep or relax). i would definitely recommend this hotel - a gem!!
truthful	"i called on december 6th, 2010 at 3 p.m. to book a room for an upcoming weekend getaway, and was taken aback when the phone was picked up and promptly hung up without a word. thinking this might have been a simple mistake, i gave it another try. a woman introducing herself as ""toni"" answered the phone, rushed through her introduction, sounding incredibly bored and annoyed that she had to answer the phone. barely letting a second go by after her introduction, she gave a snotty ""hello?!"" before i could open my mouth and tell her ""never mind."" never has a hotel answered my call so rudely. i'd like to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt and pin this unpleasant experience to ""toni""; however i will not be calling back again in hopes to stay at this hotel during this trip."
deceptive	i stayed at the monaco for the labor day weekend when i visited my family in chicago. it is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life. clean, comfortable and pretty. the rooms were clean and the staff is very caring. i needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink. the front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes. i will recommend monaco to anyone who will be staying in the chicago area.
deceptive	this fantastic hotel has it all: luxury, an excellent location and a fun atmosphere. the rooms are spacious and well decorated, and the staff is always helpful and courteous. whether you're traveling for business or fun, i highly recommend the hard rock hotel in chicago. i stayed there with my wife recently, we were on a short weekend break and we wanted to enjoy the music an just have fun. the hard rock certainly delivered what we were looking for. the hotel is in a central location, within easy reach of the main tourist spots in the city, however, there's superb food on site and the best entertainment you could wish for, so there's barely a need to leave to hotel! (well, we did leave the hotel to see the sights, but you know what i mean). my wife and i particularly enjoyed the gym and spa facilities, including a relaxing massage. this hotel surpassed our expectations in every possible way, and we'll surely be staying there again the next time we visit the windy city.
deceptive	i wish to express my dissatisfaction with my stay at the sofitel chicago water tower. my husband and i had planned a trip to chicago for our tenth wedding anniversary. we had gone to great expense to fly his parents in from california so they could have time with their grandchildren. my husband and i had not gone on a honeymoon because he we got deployed to iraq the week after we got married. everyone was so excited! mark and i had reservations for one of the junior suites. we hadn't gone to chicago before to be tourists and were looking forward to the view which was offered. unfortunately, when we got to our room, the view was disappointing. we had requested a non-smoking room and were assigned to one, but it was obvious to us that someone had smoked in there. i am asthmatic and became very ill. we asked to be moved to another room, but were told there were no other rooms (even downgrades) available. nothing was done to try to make up for this. because of my health, my husband and i checked out within hours of arriving for our romantic anniversary weekend. this is not how i had imagined spending such a special time. now, when i think of my 10th anniversary, i will always have this memory to tarnish it.
truthful	after reading the trip advisor reviews, i was expecting an exceptional stay. i was not impressed overall. the concierge, the view, and the hotel resturant were the highlights. the bed, although not horrible, was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home, and i do not consider myself and extremely fussy person. i was traveling for business, and although not dressed in formalwear, was also not dressed down, but all in all, it felt a bit pretentious to me. there are better options for the money, and would gladly stay at the sutton place, sheraton towers, or trump for the similar price and better stay. i would ask trip advisor to move it down in the ratings......not #1 in chicago, in my book.
deceptive	for a short time during vacation i had rented a room from the ambassador east hotel, i have to say i was quite impressed with what i experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location. the hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed, and trust me i am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot. the food is good, location is great, everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here.
deceptive	upon entering homewood suites, i was greeted by incredibly friendly staff and my breath was taken by the beauty of the hotel. when i saw my room, i was immediately relieved because it provided all of the amenities needed for my week-long business stay (refrigerator, microwave, stove, dishwasher, flat panel tv). best of all, the hotel has an on-site fitness center where i was able to work off all of the extra calories i consumed during the delicious complimentary breakfast. i couldn't resist their omelettes! the hotel is in the heart of chicago and i must say, the city view from my room was priceless. definitely recommended!
deceptive	the hyatt regency chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that i have ever stayed at. i stayed there for 3 days and two nights. my room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully. the staff was very kind and very helpful. the concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in chicago. overall, a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city.
deceptive	"i stayed at the hilton chicago back in july. for a ""luxury"" hotel this place did not meet my expectations. for starters, we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room wouldn't be ready for at least another hour! i'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee. since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel's restaurants, kitty o'sheas. well, we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks. once we finally got to our room it was ok, although not great for the price. we had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view, and there were not extra towels as i had requested. we had to call room service twice to receive them, then another two times because our air conditioner wasn't working. fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so i could barely use internet on my phone. next time i'm in the chicago area i won't be staying at the hilton. i'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money."
deceptive	my company was hosting a seminar at the millennium knickerbocker hotel in chicago, il. each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel. my room had an incredible view of downtown chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern. my husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while i attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms. on saturday night, my company held a ball in the crystal ballroom. the food was excellent, the hotel chefs were the best. the servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner. our overall stay at millennium knickerbocker hotel will be forever in my memory. it was a fun filled weekend with great food, clean rooms, excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want! we will definitely be staying here again!
deceptive	while visiting the chicago area, we chose the hotel monaco chicago for our stay. as one of the premier luxury hotels in chicago, we held high expectations but were quickly disappointed in what we recieved. the problems began as soon as we arrived. the attendant was not friendly nor did she have the smile that is suppose to be the symbol of kimpton. and, when we went to our room only to discover that we had not been given what we had paid for, the situation only got worse. rather than apologize for the error (my credit card receipt was on hand) we were blamed for the indescrpencies in rooms and told that not only was the room we had reserved and paid for more than two months unavailable, we would not recieve a refund of the price difference of the two rooms. i could not believe that a top 40 u.s. hotel that is suppose to be committed to excellence could make such a blunder! with no choice but to retreat back to our room, we were pleasantly pleased with all of the amenities that we did recieve during our stay. a beautiful hotel in the chicago loop, but don't go expecting to be treated with respect or professionalism.
truthful	my sister and i stayed on the 22nd floor, there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights, beat up and old dorm style. it was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on tripadvisor did the thing get removed. breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely. all night there are chimes that make noise, that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying. there is no wifi - no matter what they tell you, i paid for the wifi, and still we were unable to get on. lastly, my sister and i split the bill, i had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit. room cost with city taxes etc. was 313.69 a night. i know the comfort inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper! so while the view was wonderful, it is not worth the money.
truthful	"seriously overpriced the room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel. the ""amenities"" were a smoke screen, nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a holiday inn. i would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that i did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase. being charged $15/day for internet on top of a $250/night rate was a bit over the top. the bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient. the shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head, unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost. the staff were friendly and helpful, actually the best part of the stay were the staff. all in all i found it overpriced for the quality of the room."
truthful	"i booked this hotel with great expectations. i had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in chicago. upon arriving to the hotel (at the exact time i indicated in my reservation) i was told i've been ""downgraded"" to a lesser quality room. i travel very often and never had this before. moreover, i did not hear a single ""i'm sorry"", it was like usual business. what bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me ""i will decrease the rate for you"" ""what do you think, nice eh?"" like he was doing me a favor!!!! they decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course (which is the legal thing to do, since i am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money). they did not care that i wanted higher level room independent of value. i did not know what to say, since this never happened to me before, also with family present did not want to start arguing. the rooms were nice (not as nice as i thought) and location is good, however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this. that is enough for me not to go back again."
truthful	i unfortunately stayed for 3 nights at the knickerbocker hotel ...i should have checked out on day 1. the bathrooms were filthy dirty with tangled hairs on the floor behind the door and after a few nights of scratching and the feeling of skin crawling...i pulled the bed away from the bedhead and watched as little rice sized brown bugs scurried over the white sheets...bed bugs! which i might add the hotel are saying are flying insects from the windows being left open from when the window cleaners were there (fortunately i took photos to the contrary) finding the bed bugs...i looked at the mattress protector and pillows and found long hairs on both...i was disgusted at the hygeine and would never stay again at this establishment.
truthful	my family and i stayed at the hyatt on wacker dr. on march 27, 2012. we were excited about the great price we got for your 4-star hotel through priceline. unfortunately, we were not impressed. in the past, we have stayed at the hyatt in downtown san diego for spring break on the marina, but chose to stay closer to home this year. the room was not clean to our standards when we arrived, even though we paid for an upgrade. we asked for it to be cleaned while we were sight seeing and were assured it would be looked after. upon our return, nothing had been moved in the room to re-clean including the tea my sons had made prior to our excursion so i can only assume, it wasn't even checked as promised. we only had 3 towels for the 4 of us and had to call for more. they were promptly delivered but room service took 40 + minutes to deliver us a knife and corkscrew we essentially paid for because we felt compelled to tip even though we had to call and ask for it twice! the curtains were dirty and frayed by the vacuuming, the bed skirt had a foreign stain on it, the honor bar/fridge was gouged and dirty, too! the mirror was dirty and the beds appeared to have been jumped on - not neat and tidy at all....there were boxes of trash in the hall and an old refrigerator or two as well. very disappointing to say the least. i have buyer's remorse and wish we had just taken the train home and stayed in our own beds! we were compensated for our upgrade - $20.00 but given the price of parking, taxes, and etc. at this point i wouldn't recommend this hyatt to anyone. my husband travels and uses his hyatt business travel points quite often and also expected better from your 4-star hotel. i felt compelled to let you know how unhappy we were with your facility.
truthful	this was a gorgeous hotel from the outside and in the lobby. however, when we reached the elevator things started to look quite dingy. our bathrooms in our room had grout that was in need of a deep scrubbing and had an overall appearance of dirty. wireless internet is available, but that's an additional fee. are you kidding? even the roach motel offers wireless for free! also, the fitness room was available for only $15 per day. wow, i thought the room rate was enough to cover that. when i used the coffee supplies in the room, they were not replenished. i called the next morning requesting more and was told that wasn't housekeeping's area but they would send some up. no kidding, nearly 90 minutes later i got the cream and sugar! glad i wasn't in a big hurry. i'll definitely be staying next door for half the cost and a lot better accommodations the next time i'm in chicago!
truthful	after reading good reviews about i booked a 5 night stay. checked in late bit called early in the day to assure we'd have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for 2 teens. they somehow had us booked for two rooms instead. got that sorted out and arrived around 10 pm. checked in and waited for our luggage... finally went down and got it ourselves. the room was a little grungy, furniture shabby, and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover. ewww. called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me. fyi it's kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel. next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didn't work. called for a replacement, waited a while, called again and was brought another iron which also didn't work. third time was a charm. oh boy. too bad we paid in advance. won't be staying here again.
truthful	"going to the internet retailer 2010 at the last minute and this was the only hotel left available with shuttle services. first of all, from reading other reviews, now i know i got ripped @ $249 a night when priceline folks are sniping these rooms for $79 (albiet, i got free wifi). the hotel is nice; but it can only get so nice for an oldie...no matter how much money you dump into it. shower head was really low (i'm 6'1""), water pressure was low. it is in a decent part of town with a hype bar close by (check out reviews on yelp!) for some off reason i ended up with two double beds (they asked me a few times if i was traveling alone). if traveling here: 1 - make sure you get a better deal than i did 2 - confirm your exact needs with reservation over the phone and in person 3 - don't have super high hopes my room was neither up to par as a business class (although the 22nd floor is called the executive floor) nor was it a good fit for the romantic couple...it wasnt even spacious enough for those last minute get awayers (sp?) trying to save money."
truthful	i stayed @ affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from nw suburbs to women's hospital oir my surgery. few things i really didn't enjoy - i could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors.no noise insulation at all! very dusty between window frames(i understand - cars,pollution) but it looked like it wasn't cleaned for a very long time.one more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side. i was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time...we didn't notice the problem until very-very late.the affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of chicago as well as northwestern hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort ! strange but every hotel i stayed @ was supplied with the sealed roll of toilet paper.affinia didn't even offer that.looked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady! neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use!!!!!!!!!!!! hopefully,no more surgeries for me...won't stay @ this place for leisure - even with discount!
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel i am a business woman who travels a great deal out of a month, therefore, my accommodations must meet the highest standards. i was booked for a stay at the omni chicago hotel, located in what is referred to as ' the magnificent mile ' in the greater chicago area. ' magnificent ', it was! the beautifully red-bricked sky scraper was indeed a breath- taking sight and upon entrance, i had a felling of warmth from the very hospitable welcoming staff. i was impressed with the hotels special rates offered during prime business hours and the guest rooms ranged everything from ' the presidential suite to the governors suite '. i accepted a more humble room as i would not need to spend very much time there during the day. i did stay inside most nights and the amenities were more than satisfactory. i enjoyed the very spacious exercise room and afterwards, i would take a quick dip in the pool. i toured the hotel as my niece is planning her wedding and just so happens to live close to the hotel. the ' chagall ballroom ', was elegant enough for such an occasion and reeked of pure luxury. i was given very adequate maps and directions to and from as my business was conducted throughout the city. that was a life saver. all in all, my experience was more than favorable and i would definitely stay there again along with recommending it to anyone.
deceptive	when my sister got married last summer, our stay at the sheraton hotel was delightful! billy and the kids and i were exhausted after the long flight from san francisco, so it's a good thing that we found the perfect place to relax! the kids adored the indoor pool, billy couldn't stop talking about the beautiful jogging path, and i even pampered myself by taking advantage of the massage therapy before the big day. the reception dinner at shula's steakhouse was fun and delicious. i would definitely recommend this hotel to any one who is in chicago for an extended visit!
deceptive	very luxurious and worth the money. if you are looking to relax and unwind in a great hotel then this is the one to choose. the staff was great and friendly. dont forget the 24 hour room service which is a great treat.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago while in town for business, and enjoyed my stay very much. i stayed in a room with a king bed, which was very comfortable. the room had all the things i needed for my stay, which was nice. the only thing is i think there was a party on my floor, but they quieted down quickly enough. my room even had an internet connection! i also had dinner one night at the china grill, and it was an amazing meal! overall, i had a great stay, and will return next time i am in chicago.
deceptive	sofitel not-so-luxury hotels i recently checked out from a short stay at the chicago water tower. i originally planned to stay for a week but as my business was concluded after only 3 days i decided i had had my share of the water tower. simply put it offered no reasons to stay. the hotel is quite lovely and elegantly dressed to impress, but little more is put forth to sway the more acquainted crowed. the first night was a spectacle meal and there was quite a crowd, i think for the weekend. the next night the food was only mediocre and the third when i orderd room service i had to call twice. even if you don't care about the food i think you would be wise to think twice about your stay if you have the choice. they put on quite a show, but that is all and when the show ended i was still hungry for more and there was no more to be found.
deceptive	my husband and i recently stayed stayed at the hilton chicago and it was a horrible experience. when we arrived, the front desk clerk was on the phone on what sounded like a personal call and didn't even acknowledge us for at least five minutes. when we got to our room i went to lay on the bed and noticed a black hair on the pillow. i'm am very paranoid about hotels being dirty, so i pulled back the sheets and moved all the pillows around and noticed several more hairs. i called for some new sheets which they said they would send right up but it actually took nearly 30 minutes. the second night we were there we decided to try the irish pub in the hotel called kitty o'sheas because my husband loves pub food. we had the shepherd's pie which was awful. it was watery and had no flavor and it was not cheap! our server seemed annoyed when we complained and did not offer it to be taken off the check. while we had a great trip to chicago, the hilton was definitely not a highlight of our trip. overall, we had rude service, a dirty room and bad food. spend your money elsewhere
truthful	overall the hotel is very nice. the rooms are spacious and well-appointed, but they tend to be aging or dated. my bathroom was particularly below average, with old wallpaper and a dingy tub with a crummy showerhead. the toilet paper roll holder was pulling out of the wall and its screws were exposed. the conceirge recommended an expensive and mediocre restaurant. i hate it when they do that- it makes me suspect they're getting kickbacks from places that otherwise don't get enough business on their own. breakfast was very good. it's a relatively large european-style spread.
deceptive	this hotel was an absolute dream to stay in. i couldn't have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury. i enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered.the room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well. i honestly felt like i was at a spa! the price was very reasonable as well. i would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone i know. if you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms!!!
deceptive	i am writing about my recent stay at the ambassador east hotel. i just wanted to let you know what a wonderful team you have working there. everyone from check-in to check-out couldn't have been more helpful or personable. it made my mundane business trip a very pleasureable one. the hotel is spotless, very comfortable and the restaurant is one of chicago's finest. you really offer the finest quality in both product and service. the only complaint i have is that internet access is not free. i would just like to mention one person in particular- sofie. she worked on the front desk and she went above and beyond to make my stay as smooth as possible. she even helped me out with taxi services and local recommendations. i shall look forward to returning next month. thank you. yours, p. grady
deceptive	my family and i went to this hotel on holiday last month. it was a very bad hotel. when we got there we imediatly checked in and went up to our room. the view from the window was a brick wall. really? we even asked the lasy at the front desk, but she said they couldn't put us in a room with a view cause we didn't book one and we couldn't upgrade. also, my wife is a light sleeper and the trains kept her up at night. another thing is alot of ads boast a hot tub in all the rooms but this is not true, our room only had a normal tub. but, the tub had no stopper, so we could only take showers. the room was also very small compared to other hotels with around the same prices.
truthful	ok, so first trip to chicago and i was a litlle worried about the hotel and the location, finally i decided on the conrad and wath a good experience i had, i booked a king deluxe room on the 6th floor, view was not amazing but that was the only coplaint i could had, room is nice, bath was all appliances and good size, good plasma tv, free internet, we asked one day for breaksfast and amazing food! so overall and for the price aroufn 220 it was a great surprise, the locating was very good a few blocks from everything and very quiet hotel
deceptive	"upon first inspection, sofitel chicago water tower looks like an excellent place to spend a few days in the heart of downtown chicago, but appearances can certainly be deceiving. best summed up, sofitel is nothing more than a fancy holiday inn. it certainly shows that this hotel is part of a chain, even if it is an international one. the customer service is poor unless you look like you have $50 to tip someone. the furniture throughout the establishment looks and feels like it cane from ikea. the rooms are dirty when you first walk in, the air feels stale, and the views are certainly all they're cracked up to be. none of this is worth a ""luxury"" price or even worthy of a ""luxury"" name. i will certainly not be staying here again."
truthful	what a quaint, warm and friendly place to stay! very accomodating ..had 2 dble beds and bathroom was fine....a bit small compared to usa hotels....but compared to european travel...the place was palatial! would def. stay here again. location is great too!
truthful	the heating in our room didn't work and wasn't repaired depite numerous requests, the rooms were very small, the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay, the cleaner made the bed but nothing else, when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the 5 night stay despite my having pre-paid through a travel agent, it took the hotel 2 months to re-credit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous trans-atlantic phone calls to them.
deceptive	the james hotel in chicago looks nice on the website, but looks can be deceiving! the employees are extremely rude and the rooms are disgusting. i would definitely advise against staying there.
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel for a business meeting and had an absolutely horrible experience. when i arrived, exhausted after a series of delayed flights, i was told that my room was not ready. not ready at 5pm, are you kidding me! after waiting in the lobby for 30 minutes i was finally called over to the desk only to be told my king room was changed to a room with two queen beds, fine, whatever. i get up to my room and unload all of my bags only to find my a/c doesn't work. i call down to the desk and the clerk tells me that they are sold out and there is no where to move me but she could discount my rooms $20. no apology. nothing. im exhausted and deal with my 80+ degree room. when i went to check out the next morning i find out no one even bothered to apply the discount. again, no apology. i have never received such poor customer service in my life and will not be comming back.
deceptive	the palmer house hilton is an incredible break from the real world. the lobby is a throwback to the grand era of travel, and you can just imagine people stepping off the train with their steamer trunks. the lobby is luxe and gilded, with soaring ceilings and is staffed with friendly, accommodating employees. the rooms are plush, with each bed furnished with a serenity dreams topper for extra comfort. the room decor is modern and sleek, a world from the tacky furnishings in most hotels. for your convenience, there's a fully-stocked business center, pool, fitness room and workout area - something to accommodate the solo, business or family traveller.
deceptive	"i was consistently disappointed throughout my stay at the james. i had heard from others that it was ""agreeable"" and ""workable"" and ""all right,"" or even ""a nice place."" i figured that there would be no problems and booked a guestroom for a long weekend visit with my long-distance girlfriend. according to the website, i was about to immerse myself and my date in a bath of cutting-edge contemporary furnishings and ""warm tones."" well, when i arrived, i felt like i was in an ikea showroom just before closing time on a busy day. everything in the front was just a bit too askew. the staff were busy, distracted, inattentive, and in every way keen to show me i was a bother to them. i handled my own bags far too much to be convinced of their commitment to my comfort. i also thought my room was quite pathetic for its price. it looked distinctly like someone had rolled around on the beds just before i got there. the bathroom fixtures felt a little bit gross and smelled very strongly, inexplicably, of men's cologne. nobody cared when i complained of this and suggested that maybe it was just ""stuck in my nose"" and that it would go away. well, it didn't, and i had a horrible headache by the time my lady arrived. this ruined my entire first evening in chicago. for my price i could have stayed a week at an economy hotel, gotten my personal items treated for bedbugs, and still saved money. and i would not have been treated like such a pest. needless to say, i will be looking elsewhere when i go back to chicago. i may not be a frequent patron of luxury hotels, but i know when i am wasting my money."
deceptive	"just what i needed at james: i can't tell you how impressed i was with my stay at the james chicago hotel. i came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the james by a friend. the crisp, clean, contemporary ambiance made me feel like i was on a relaxed vacation rather than work. it was luxury without being over the top. my room was clean, comfortable and was above all standards comfortable. in my down time i enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the ""jbar"", and i highly recommend dinner at the ""david burke primehouse"" the customer service from all the staff members, from front desk, to house keeping to the bartender was excellent. i plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience."
deceptive	the millennium hotel knickerbocker sounds fine, and the website is pretty, but the reality is an over-hyped, overpriced, reality-isn't-as-good-as-fantasy package. the catering they offer is a joke; you can pick up better food for half the price at a dozen or more places in the chicago area. while the rooms were cleaner than most, there was a lingering unpleasant odor from the cleaners they used that aggravated my sinuses, and when i called to complain about it, a nasal-voiced clerk blew me off. the rooms look small but cozy when you book online, but when you get there in person, you realize just how tiny they are. trying to fit inside of one makes you think of being in a sardine can -- did i mention that it smelled like cleaning solution? i also found a hair on my supposedly clean bed, which made me wonder just how thorough their housekeeping staff is. in fact, it looks like all of their rooms are comparatively small; you'd get better prices and a far better room from the hilton.
deceptive	home away from home! the suites are amazing with great views of the city. the food is delious and served by an excellent staff. i loved the heated pool on the top floor, very relaxing after a long day of meetings. great place to stay when your in chicago!
truthful	"i stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in september for a ""pleasure trip"" -- the intercontinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent. the room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new lg flat panel tv. had breakfast at zest (hotel restaurant) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet. the hotel is in walking distance to millenium park, museums and the aquarium. there is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though, considering the sales tax is 9.5%! (and possibly raising to 11%) great stay. i highly recommend it and would stay there again."
deceptive	on a recent stay at the fairmont chicago millemmium park hotel i was appalled at the service i received at such a supposedly high end hotel. when i arrived i had to wait in the lobby for 15 minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in. apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with. finally i was given the key to my non-smoking room away from the vending area. much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and i heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight. and the room was obviously a room for smokers. the blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke. i, of course complained, but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but i was welcome to check out and go to another hotel. after a fitfull night's sleep i awoke to children running up and down the hallway. their parents were no where in sight. my shower was cold and had no pressure. i was given two towels one of which had not been laundered. i could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him i would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it. i cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark.
truthful	i already wrote a review about all the free stuff you get but now i'm going to write about the location! i like to walk. this place was close to everything!!!! the 'taste of chicago' was on during the 4th of july. let me tell you, this was the best 'taste' of a city that i have ever been to. it was massive and took 10 mins to walk there. i took the train in from the airport (it was around $2.00 but it was a solid 45 mins but for $2.00, how can you complain?)and it was approx a 10 walk to the hotel. we pretty much walked everywhere. we walked the entire magnificent mile strip. we went to the blue navy or whatever the docks are called. my favourite bar was 'pops for champagne.' wow. i love champagne. and then of course there was the john hancock centre. and lots of shopping!
truthful	"this is a tough one to review... as the star ratings were from 1 star to 5 and had to figure out an average.... 2 is where it was. here are my tips and props/complaints: room: 1 star. i had a corner suite. the room was pretty nasty actually (2703..stay away from it!!!). there was a constant banging noise from above. when i first got in i thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding. after an hour, i knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong. well, the sound continued on for 3 days. not that i minded too much as i keep things on for white noise... but it sure would bug others. also, there were about 10 cig burns on the carpet and sofa. in addition, it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa. also, there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat. i could not imagine all the dna left on that thing either. *gags* bathroom: nice size but not great. the faucet was lose (really lose) and the toilet would not flush right. service: great. everyone i encountered did a great job making me feel welcome. good stuff. food: i had meetings there, so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made. it was really good... much better than most hotels. bar: very cool. good music, great service and good drinks. the scene was decent as well. small bar, but was not cramped. so, maybe other rooms are nicer... well hell they better be. regardless, if one room is like that (especially a ""suite""), i have to think others are like that as well. it is too bad though. the views are great and they actually have windows that open... big shocker for the city in general!"
deceptive	"chicago is my favorite city visit. i wanted to share this special city with a new love and booked us a room at the swissotel. it is advertised as close to downtown and close to the museums of chicago. i wanted to share my new love. it was indeed close to the museums but to get to either the shopping district or the chicago art institute it was a long walk, full of detours, and it was not easy to grab a cab. while the rooms seemed to be luxuriously decorated the beds were uncomfortable and the rooms just were not very clean. the room service was slow, the food arrived cold, and the total experience was way so expensive for what we got. i do not think i have ever experienced the level of noise in such a ""grand hotel"" as the swissotel seems. i would not recommend the swissotel because disappointment, noise, and cold food should just not cost that much."
deceptive	"i have recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park and the visit was most unpleasant. this hotel was loud and the staff was very rude. all the fancy lights and designs are just a distraction from the snobby people who stay there and the people who work there that seem to hate their jobs. the hotel food was old, it seemed like they were making it all at once for all the people staying there. the beds were hard and uncomfortable and it was an over all bad experience in what looked like a ""nice place to spend a vacation"""
deceptive	"recently my husband and i stayed at the james in chicago for our ""night on the town"". after taking in a musical, we checked in at the james and were happily surprised with the customer appreciation and delicious room service. the rooms were spotless and we were supplied with fresh towels for everything from showers to the spa to visiting the gym. if i had known that they accepted pets beforehand, it would've been a great environment for our family lapdog. staying at the james in chicago made our night a luxurious outing and will be a definite stop next time we are in chicago."
deceptive	hard rock hotel boats that they have the best of the high scale accommodations for your business or pleasure stays. what they fail to disclose is just how expensive your stay will be. the service tends to be heavily influenced by the wealth of the patrons, service is more redily available and friendly the more you make.the rooms are furnished with attractive but old furnishings. the laundry service leaves more to be desired. the sheets have a gray tint to them and the rooms smell of tobacco. i recently stayed at the hard rock hotel and was disappointed with not only the service but the cleanliness of the room from the bathroom to the bedding.your stay at any hotel should be memorable and restful-after all isnt that what we pay for?
truthful	we stayed for a one night getaway with family on a thursday. triple aaa rate of 173 was a steal. 7th floor room complete with 44in plasma tv bose stereo, voss and evian water, and gorgeous bathroom(no tub but was fine for us) concierge was very helpful. you cannot beat this location... only flaw was breakfast was pricey and service was very very slow(2hours for four kids and four adults on a friday morning) even though there were only two other tables in the restaurant. food was very good so it was worth the wait. i would return in a heartbeat. a gem in chicago...
deceptive	"although the intercontinental chicago hotel is located on ""the magnificent mile,"" our entire experience as guests there was anything but ....believe me, the ""magnificence"" ends at the hotel entrance! from check-in to check-out, our impressions ranged from lackluster to horrific. first, there was an error with our reservation, and once we got to our room, we found that neither our phone nor our internet connection worked, so down i trudged to the registration desk--where i had to wait in line for at least twenty minutes--to ask for help. the first night we spent was nearly totally sleepless due to tv noise coming from the next room; we weren't sure whether it was due to excessively inconsiderate neighbors or thin walls. then, dog tired the next morning--even though we had hung a ""do not disturb"" sign on our door handle--in barged the maid all bright-eyed and bushy tailed with scrubber in hand. following that rude awakening, i was jarred again by a blood-curdling shriek from my wife, who, upon entering the bathroom to take her shower, was greeted by an incredibly large roach! breakfast--actually all meals of which we partook at the hotel--were served cold and were somewhat tasteless. we were routinely ignored by the concierge, who always seems to be on a personal call whenever we needed him. trying to leave the hotel was equally as difficult as checking in. of course, there was a gross error in our bill which caused us to be delayed in our effort to depart. getting out of the intercontinental chicago was, believe me, the best part of our experience as guests there."
truthful	"chicago is one of our favorite cities to visit. some friends suggested trying the talbott. i'm delighted we took them up. the talbott is a great ""small"" hotel a block and a half off of michigan avenue near the four seasons, drake and westin. the concierge staff was most helpfull. gene and stephanie took great care of us. the rooms were spacious and very fresh. the elevators could be a bit slow at times. aside from the construction next door, our stay was perfect. bice now runs the hotel restaurant. we enjoyed having breakfast there. we will stay there again."
truthful	generally speaking, nothing bad about that place if there would not be the cleaning issue. we checked the closed with the mini bar (picture uploaded), so much dust, nobody cleaned here for at least 3 years. we called in housekeeping, giving them the opportunity to check and do something about it. still the same situation when returning to the room 4 hrs. later. next day moved to a renovated room, much better but not 5 star clean at all. in addition, there was never a time when there was no waiting line at the reception, no wonder when just 1/3 of the counters is actually open. please do something about these issues its ruining everything!
truthful	this hotel was chosen by my husband's company as the family came along for the business trip. the location was excellent and we had a great view of the lake and aquarium from the 34th floor. my first impressions were that the room was very nice and everything appeared to be clean. the lobby was undergoing renovation at the entrance, but was otherwise ok. lots of conferences were taking place so the wait for the elevators was long. seemed like only 2 elevators were working out of the 6 that were there. i had read from another reviewer to join the fairmont president's club and wi-fi in the room would be free. we signed up for the club, but were puzzled as to why they don't just offer everyone free wi-fi. parking fees were exorbitant at $58/night, but thankfully the company was paying for this. we were able to walk to millennium park and navy pier from our hotel. the hotel is not kid-friendly in terms of restaurants or amenities. there is no swimming pool, but the concierge arranged for us to swim at the swissotel next door (there is an underground tunnel that connects the fairmont there). we loved the swissotel's pool on the 42nd floor. fantastic views from the pool! although the beds were comfortable, my daughter and i were both victims of bed bugs during our stay. unfortunately we didn't know until the next day after we returned home. apparently bed bug bites can take up to 7 days to appear. my daughter and i both shared a bed and were bitten on our sides from our necks to our hips. the bites made you want to claw your skin off! my husband and son who shared the other bed were not bitten at all. beware of room 3405 -- bed nearest the bathroom!!! i will not be fooled by a clean room again and will be checking under mattresses from now on....
truthful	we just got back from a great weekend in chicago and have no complaints about the palmer house. it's very easy to get to from o'hare(the blue line on the el train) and then just a 2 block walk from the train station. the hotel itself is beautiful and the staff is super friendly and go out of their way to help. we booked an air/hotel package deal on expedia. we expected to stay in a room with a full size bed but for only $45 extra per night we upgraded to the excutive level! best decision of the trip. we had a beautiful room with a king bed,down comforter,robes,plush towels etc...it also included a nice continental breakfast each morning,all day snacks and beverages and a great happy hour! we took advantage of this every day. the location was great..lots of shopping along state st. and to get to the magnificent mile was a $5 cab ride or a 20 minute walk! we'll be back to chicago and the palmer house!
truthful	no excuse for a hotel like this to have cold showers on three consecutive days and then to tell customer that engineering will look at it and that we should have told them sooner. i wouldn't expect a cold shower at a budget hotel, let alone an omni. great location and the bar is nice.
truthful	"imo the amalfi doesnt come close to justifying the glowing comments on ta. this is basically a holiday inn. half of the rooms overlook an alley / loading dock. the hotel is not more than 6 or 7 flors high and the garbage pick up woke me up daily at 5 am. at 530, when you are just nodding off again, they begin setting up for the complimentary breakfast. this is a continental buffet on every floor next to the elevator bank. any room within 100 feet of the elevators will hear the noise. reception was a bit tacky and the ""staff"" was a little rough around the edges. i didn't see a single business travellers while i was there. valet parking was expensive (usual for chicago) but was very slow. just ok. explore other options."
deceptive	if anyone is traveling to chicago, i would strongly recommend the palmer house hilton. i have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and i was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel. i had a guest room with a double bed. at the first sight, the room had perfect decor. the double bed looked comfy and cozy. it wasn't just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me. since i was in a hurry in my two-day stay, i didn't have time to wander around the town for food. it wasn't a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks. the good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night. i can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks. if you are just touring the city, the hotel is quite close to parks, museum, and a lot of shopping places. if you just need a place to stay, the view from the hotel was pretty good as well. among all the hotels i have spent time in, the palmer house hilton tops the list.
truthful	"the room itself was fine and comfortable(very peaceful), but the customer service by the so-called, concierge or ""experience something or the others"" left much to be desired. first, i arrived and the doorman walked me to the desk. i was not greeted with the usual ""hello, welcome to..."". instead, i got, ""your name? id?"" no, ""hello"", no ""welcome to the amalfi hotel,"" just plain old poor customer service from the very beginning! that left a very bad taste in my mouth, but i decided to let it go and see how the rest of my stay was."
deceptive	"advertised as a luxury hotel the conrad chicago is more gouge than grand. my wife and i decided to splurge on a fabulously decadent weekend in chicago for our tenth anniversary. after looking at several hotels in the ""magnificent mile"" territory of downtown chicago we selected the conrad. the conrad's website impressed us immediately. the pictures of the rooms were lovely, they promised what was supposed to be a world class spa and several amenities such as huge flat screen televisions, not that we were planning to watch much tv. we called to make reservations and after navigating a ridiculous automated phone system, i was greeted by a rather irritated sounding young woman who couldn't figure out how i was unable to make my reservations via the automated system. in any case i picked the deluxe king-size bed room for two nights in mid september. my wife oohed and aaahed over the picture of the room online, most impressed with the view. it cost a pretty penny, more than i would normally spend on out of town accomidations, but her happiness was worth it. unfortunately her happiness was short lived after arrival at the conrad. valet parking was a breeze but they accidentally grabbed my wife's purse when unloading the luggage. we spent an hour in panic before a bellhop finally located it. at the front desk they were pleasant but adamant that we had reserved a room with two double beds via the automated phone system. i explained the error to the woman at the counter who was able to get us into a king-sized room but at an additional cost. by the time we arrived at our room we were a bit haggard but still looking forward to our stay. that ended when we found out that our ""view"" was of a back alley service corridor. so much for the skyline. overall, the room was clean and lovely though housekeeping seemed unduly slow. i hate to be picky but i was drip dried way before my extra towels were sent up. the spa had very limited hours as well. somehow amidst it all we managed to have the anniversary of our dreams, away from the hotel. it was far from luxury service even if the sheets were of an extravagant thread count. i would not recommend the conrad chicago. i would absolutely save my money next time to spend on activities and sightseeing in chicago. i was expecting outstanding hospitality and found it no better than a mid-range priced hotel which would also have had clean rooms, but wouldn't have cleaned out so much of my wallet."
truthful	we usually stay at the sofitel but thought we would try the conrad for a change. i don't think i would rate this hotel over the sofitel but it was still 1st class. but i do think the service was better at the conrad. we arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left. normally service goes down hill then but our waiter eric was the best. even when i kept ordering my after dinner ports. the meal may not have been the chop house but it was still very good. the bar was ok, no crown reserve. they did have the cask 16 at $24 a drink, ouch. the room service was very quick. our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits. the only fault we could find was the temperature on the 14th floor. it was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off. which wasn't so bad since my wife smokes. the temp on the 5th where the lobby, bar, and restaurant was fine. we enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in sept. one last thing, if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast. go to the west egg, only a few blocks away.
truthful	"this hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood. the owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an ""upscale"" overpriced boutique hotel. but it's still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job. stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse, but with all the sleaze removed. definitely stay at the chain's other location, the burnham, for a much, much nicer hotel."
truthful	we arrived at the omni on 2nd september for a 6 day stay. i took ill when i left the plane after travelling from manchester so i saw more of the room than i anticipated. i couldn't go out for 4 days. the room was spacious and clean. the bed was extremely comfortable. the bathroom was large and very clean. what more could you ask. we had coffee and juice left outside our door every morning at the time we requested. i managed to go to the 5th floor to see the sun terrace (outside the gym) having a sun terrace in a city hotel is a great idea but the terrace was a bit grim. a few sunbeds on a concrete floor. there was also noise from an air conditioning unit. it could do with a bit of cheering up. what i saw of chicago was very pleasing, it has something for everyone. would i go back to the omni? yes i would.
truthful	stayed valentines weekend. got the 5th floor with a direct view of the building next door. you have to pay extra for the pool and the ice machine was out on our floor. parking nearby sucks as most of chicago or pay 50 for valet to go through your car. glasses were dusty and gross. this location is notorious for having super sensitive scales on the mini fridge, so when you barely touch it you'll get a bill at 3 in the morning under your door. had i been on a higher floor and had a better view it would be a 4 star but not this time.
deceptive	i enjoyed my stay at the talbott hotel. it is on the more expensive side, but it is all worth it. i got the talbott tradition package, which was $245 for two people and included a $30 breakfast credit on check out day. the rooms are huge! the beds are soft and comfortable. they include aveda bath products, which is a plus in my book. they also have a nice fitness area & pool you can use while you stay there. one thing i thought was really cool is that you can forward your messages from your hotel room phone to your cell phone. my boyfriend also liked the ihome audio system. the location of this hotel is very convenient as well, its close to several great restaurants and blocks from the coast. but, what i like best about this hotel is that they make an honest effort to not negatively impact the environment more than they need to. they were one of the first hotels to be green sealed. overall i had a great stay at talbott hotel!
deceptive	i just got home from my stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel. me and my family were in chacago for the the week and this hotel was the closest to where we needed to be. when we walked in the door there was a horrid odor. almost like a public bathroom. the check in clerk was very irritable and was very uncooperative. she would not let us go to our rooms because our entire family was not there yet! when we finally got to our rooms the beds were not made and the room was uninviting. the beds felt like we were sleeping on rocks. after the first dreadful night we got up and went downstairs to eat breakfast. the food there tastes and looks like vomit. the rest of the weeks stay there was like living in hell. the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel is definitely not a good place to stay. it is actually probably on of the worst hotels i've ever stayed at.
truthful	my stay was quick but awesome. after a long day, seeing a substantial line at check-in was a bit of a groaner, but then i saw the self-serve kiosks. i was checked in with keys in hand in under 3 minutes. in the morning i was able to check out on the tv in my room. the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its 1927 origins. the bed was fabulously comfortable. i wish i could live there. they have many rooms wtih 2 bathrooms. i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn't know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms. talk about squeals of delight. that was about 7 years ago in virginia beach. i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms, but it's the first time i've seen this since. what a great feature!
truthful	while i had stayed in the hotel monaco before, this was my husband's first trip to chicago and i insisted we stay here as i loved it the first time. well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful. the warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing. unfortunately we missed the wine hour. one thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to chicago a day late -- hotel monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation.
deceptive	the hard rock should stick to restaurants. after a recent stay at the hard rock hotel in chicago i think they should go back to what there good at. besides having to wait an hour for my room to be ready (this is after my check in time), the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that i was being delayed. after seeing the state the room was in i still do not understand what took so long. the sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed. the bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it (i will leave out the details). complaining didn't seem to get me anywhere, they offered me a small discount at the hotel's bar. after this experience i will be more likely to book at a motel 6 then return to the hard rock.
deceptive	there are many high-quality hotels in chicago. there are many high-quality hotels on the magnificent mile and then there is the affinia chicago. with its neo-classical stylings and its non-classical service, it is just a combination for trouble, we had established our reservations for friday the 15th amd arrived at 4pm to check-in. no room. one hour after their posted check in time and nothing. no apology, no offer for upgrade, no discount. nothing. as a seasoned traveler i have had my share of disappointments but this tops the list.
truthful	i stayed in this hotel for a week and i was looking forward to a stay at a top class hotel. i was shocked and disapointed with my stay, here are some of my gripes - room had a broken phone and broken lightbulb - breakfast service was slow and impolite - hotel rationed shampoo (one bottle for two people sharing and did not refill a bottle that was less than half full). - we also shared a bar of soap. i was so disappointed with this hotel, i paid for a premium hotel and got a very disappointing stay.
truthful	"not worth the price. we almost stayed at a hotel for $110 a night, but instead choose the hard rock for $180 (a special). we were located on the ""newly renovated"" beatles floor. the carpets in the hallways looked like they needed to be replaced. upon entering our room we found some cool beatles artwork along with a 3x4 foot marilyn manson portrait. i think they were halfway done re theming the room. at checkout they tried to charge us $11 for using the mini-bar which we didn't even open. they removed the charge right away but i wonder if they try to get unsuspecting people with that charge. nothing special here. if you want to pay a bunch extra for some light theming then this is the place for you."
truthful	i was in chicago from september 17-22 for a convention.. my company booked this hotel for me. the hotel is centrally located , michican ave is less than a block away. perfect location! the suites are huge with comfy beds and a beautiful kitchenette. breakfast is the best... bountiful.. not just muffins and toast... i mean everything you can imagine...waffles, bacon, sausage , hash browns, toast, danishes, omelets, burritos, all freshly made... not artifical... really good. and clean .. also they have a free dinner... buffet.. excellent... mexican night, chinese night, american fare.. all included.. wine and beer also.. well worth the expensive price of $279 a night. a very classy and clean hotel.. i love chicago... will come again!
deceptive	i work for a software marketing firm, and that job requires me to travel at least 100 days per year. i spend a large amount of time in hotels. i normally don't write reviews for hotels, but the homewood suites by hilton were above and beyond. let's start where it matters: the rooms. they are top notch. there's nothing better than walking in to a clean, beautiful rooms after a long day of travel. the beds are among the best i've ever slept in in hotels. the rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home. the price: low. i looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels, and everything else was at least 10% more expensive. but you don't get what you pay for here. you get much more than that! the location: couldn't be better. you want to go to a world class restaurant? that's within walking distance. you want a great shopping experience? again, walking distance. anything else you want? chances are, it's within walking distance. overall, one of the best hotels i've ever stayed in.
truthful	"stayed here as a treat to myself while in chicago recently for a concert. i totally loved it here!! when you called either the front desk or room service, the phone was answered with ""hallo mrs (name)"" which was a great personal touch. vanessa at the front desk, went out her way to help me - storing some things in a safe for me before i could book into my room. my room was wonderful - the bathroom was luxurious. i was on the 30th floor and the views were superb. we ordered room service and it came quickly and the guy was so friendly and nice. the doormen were great too and i wore jeans and a tshirt one day and they still opened the door for me, so no snobbery there. comfortable, cozy bathrobes were available in the bathroom, the lights went on in the wardrobe (never seen that before!!), tv was hd ready and flat screen. the bed was like sleeping on a cloud - best sleep for a while. would i stay here again?? oh yeah!! no problem - just need to save up first!!"
deceptive	my daughter wanted to spend the weekend in chicago for her 21st birthday recently, and i wanted to find the best hotel for her experience. i looked at the hotel website and really like hotel allegro's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services, so i booked us for a friday and saturday night. upon arriving, the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant. not enough to warrant a verbal complaint, but enough to make my daughter and i feel uneasy. after check-in, which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing, we headed to our room trying to be optimistic. our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested, the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound, and we only had a stock of 2 towels, which were never replaced during our stay. we made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. it was a huge disappointment, for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl. i highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel. there are much better choices in the chicago area.
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago hotel terrible. first of all, the continental breakfast was a joke. the food was unhealthy and unsatisfactory. after our first night, we expected the maid to come clean up our room. we came back from site-seeing to find that our room was in the same condition we left it in. i will never go back to this hotel again.
truthful	i'll keep it short. my wife, daughter and i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. we go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel. location: it is located in the center of the magnificent mile (michigan ave.), so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do. hotel: the hotel itself is very clean, as were the rooms. maid service was excellent, including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service (i think they missed a night). service: every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind. they always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile. every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room (sometimes chocolates on our pillows). they always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it. there was no shortage of people to ask things. my only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get. they shouuld have more than one, or longer hours. other: we had breakfast in the 676 restaurant and it was very good, and well attended, appointed. they even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet. the pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids. it was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking. pool and changing areas were spotless. room: clean, sunny and spacious. probably over 400 sq. ft. - 2 tvs, couch, desk, chairs - all in perfect shape. the windows open for some fresh air. pillows were pretty comfortable. with all aspects considered, i think this was an unbeatable value! i would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend. i truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel. it was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there. omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number. the airlines have cornered the market on that.
truthful	i loved the ambassador! what a great hotel. it's really beautiful, and the room was absolutely striking, very classic and elegant. everything was done really well: the staff treated me like a regular. this is a top-notch hotel, the best place i've stayed in a long time. my only complaint is that i wish it was on the mile, but that's it.
deceptive	hotel monaco is a luxurious hotel situated in the heart of chicago. it is blooming with historical elegance combined with modern day amenities. i had the pleasant experience of staying at this facility. perfectly set up to handle any business traveler, sight seer, convention, wedding or shopper. they offer top notch service from reservations to wedding planning or even asking for a good local restaurant. i noticed that world travelers are welcome here with some of the employees ability to speak foreign languages. guest rooms offer stylish charm and can relax even the unrelaxable. in room spa's and top notch room service is second to none. the south water kitchen is a true downtown chicago restaurant offering mid-west american dishes and several signature cocktails. i know that anytime i visit chicago, hotel monaco is my place to be.
truthful	this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago, and i've been to this hotel at least 4 times. the rooms are clean, wonderfully designed and comfortable. the staff is friendly, service focused - and the restuarant is great, especially for the breakfast fruit crepes. love this hotel. it's a great location, very good and consistent service and quality .
truthful	"the hotel is excellently situated for visiting the art institute or millennium park. it is an ""old classic"" of a hotel, and the main lobby is a must see, but i would not stay there again. the problem with any hotel dating from long ago (the current one was built in 1923-25) is that, even with extensive remodeling (which was done in 2007-2009) it is hard to create spaces that are comparable to what is expected today (in many cases the walls are load bearing so cannot be changed too much). we had a reasonably sized room (king bed and space for a desk and lounge chair) but the bathroom was very small with little space to spread out toiletries. also, there was no coffee machine in the room - something i have come to expect in virtually all hotels these days. my major complaint about this stay was the executive lounge. it is usually worth while to pay the extra for access - in most hotels it is not much more than the cost of two breakfasts and there are usually some hors d'oeuvres in the evening along with a modest wine at a modest price. (since we are currently at the diamond level in the hilton honors program, we get access for free at the hiltons but i usually upgrade at other chains such as the hyatt.) at the palmer executive lounge i ordered a couple of glasses of wine (there was a bartender on duty) and was slightly surprised by the cost - $9/glass which came to $21.44 for two with tax and tip - and was even more surprised by the wine. it was about the worst wine i had tasted in many years. i didn't think it was even as good as trader joe's cheapest $2.99 wine that i tried a couple of weeks ago. unfortunately i didn't get a look at the bottle to see what it was (although i did notice that she had to fish it out of the back of a cupboard). i noticed that a couple of groups in the executive lounge had brought their own wine in - and i can understand iot at the prices they were charging. it then occurred to me that the wine had been sitting around open for some time. i checked the room service menu and saw that they offered three red wines by the glass - the same three varietals as at the bar. the cabernet was a william hill at $10.50/glass from room service. i presume that what i had had at some time been a william hill that had been left to turn to vinegar. it was slightly more expensive from room service, but i hope that it was in a lot better condition."
truthful	when you check into a hotel after being stuck in a airport, you areusually not in the best of mood. i, working in a upscale hotel, do encounter many guests checking in who this has happened to. all they want is a friendly face and a smooth check in. the desk clerk who checked me in at this property, did neither. she was short, rude, handed me my keys and walked away. i would never go back to this property due to this.
truthful	booked a room online and got a great rate under $200 which is very cheap for a summer hotel room in chicago in this nice location, 3 blocks i think from the water. even though our rate was so cheap, the service was wonderful, the front desk were polite& cheerful, the doormen and valet were great and helpful, and they even put a fridge in our room when we requested on, free of charge! the fitness room was clean, large and provided fruit and clean towels, and it had the greatest view of the city as it was on the top floor of the hotel. location of hotel is safe, and such a beautiful area. check the rates directly online of the hotel's website, as it was the least expensive. we will stay here again for sure.
truthful	"we booked directly with the intercontinental--a special room for our wedding night. after our wedding, we went to the hotel excited and happy. when we got there, the night changed. we were treated rudely and with no respect. they told us there was ""no room"" even though we had a confirmation number. instead of showing any empathy, they told us to go sit down while they figured out ""what to do with us"". my husband was in his tux and i was in my wedding gown! no apology! no concern! we were given $20 and told to go find a cab and take it to a hotel where they'd ""found"" a room. the intercontinental ruined our wedding night. we are telling anyone and everyone of our experience. this place was supposed to be elegant. we've never been treated so poorly. we will never stay in another intercontinental hotel and highly recommend you do not contribute to a place that would do this to a newly married couple!!! steer clear of this place."
truthful	i stayed at the hyatt for a two nights on a business trip. my room was oddly shaped to give a stunning view of the river and nbc building. both the room and the bathroom were spotless and the room had an air purifier which ran silently. the hotel was well staffed with individuals who were knowledgeable about both the hotel and the surrounding area. i would not hesitate to stay here again and plan to return with my wife for a weekend.
truthful	three nights there on business. hadn't realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement, very bleak. told the front desk that i hadn't realized about the construction, so i'd have to switch hotels, they said they were still going to charge me for 3 nights. so i stayed. tv didn't work. tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me...eventually after i called again, a few hours later, a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it. long and complicated experience at the business center (which doesn't open until 9am, btw), where i ended up paying $45 to print 55 pages. had to buy these cards, and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway, (and charging me for them). i was left with $22 on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the swissotel in chicago, 2000 miles from where i live. i asked for a refund on the card and -- no surprise -- she declined to help me with that. nice room, nice view, but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad. worst experience i've ever had at a hotel when traveling for business.
deceptive	i recently had my wedding at the omni hotel in chicago and i was more than pleased. the decision to use a hotel as my wedding reception venue was at first a hard one, i was worried that a hotel would be too impersonal but once i met with the staff at the omni i was certain that it was the way to go. the staff was so attentive and friendly, and i felt as if my wedding was the most important thing at the hotel. i highly recommend the omni hotel in chicago, brides will not be dissapointed!
truthful	i stayed at the hilton chicago because i was attending a conference at the hotel. the room was sufficient - had a coffee maker, bed, hangers, tv, etc. that's about where my compliments end: *restaurant rates are outrageous. $21 for a breakfast buffet? $25 to use the gym? $7.50/hr for wifi!?!?! this is unacceptable when i'm paying $249 per night. thank goodness the ice was free. *servers in the restaurant and bar were surly, not well-versed in english, and just rude. *computer monitors in rooms are silly and turn on at random times during the night *conference was incredibly cold...everybody was wearing their overcoats the entire time, despite our complaints to management. *fridge in room was not usable. had to store cold items in the ice bucket. *cable channels just flat out sucked. i was soooo bored when i had to spend an hour in my room. if i'm paying that much, at least provide the full 70 channels.
deceptive	the intercontinental hotel is truly a hidden treasure. nestled deep in sky scraping steel epicenter of downtown chicago, the hotel is a taste of both modern day luxury and old time charm. from the tiled indoor pool surrounded by high romanesque arching ceilings to the rich mahogany furniture and lace curtains in the suites, the intercontinental was built to satisfy the taste of even the most hardened traveler. book well in advance as it is one of the most sought after retreats in all of chicago.
deceptive	i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers a couple nights ago. the service was excellent!! as soon as i stepped through the door they grabbed my bags, and were helping me choose the best hotel room for me! i loved there service and the room was gorgeous! i highly recommend it for anyone, and there prices aren't as bad as others. i loved the experience and i'm sure next time i'm in the area i'll visit again!
deceptive	i have visited chicago with my family several times and have never had such a horrible hotel experience! the staff was rude and unhelpful, and they overcharged my card by more than $300! i had to spend the whole morning on the phone trying to get them to finally fix their mistake. the hotel itself didn't live up to our expectations either...the inside was dingy and needed cleaning, and our room looked like a bunch of chain smokers had just thrown a crazy party in the room. there were cigarette burns on the sheets, stains on the floor, and there was a hole in the wall where it looked like someone had punched it! we requested another room, which was only marginally better in terms of cleanliness, only to be kept up all night from the noise of our neighbors yelling and hanging out in the hallway. there are plenty of other places to stay in chicago. avoid hard rock at all costs!
truthful	spent two nights at the intercontinental on a business trip. this is a tremendous, towering hotel in one of the best locations in chicago -- right on the magnificent mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area. my room was in the historic tower -- a 1920s masonic club which has been converted at enormous expense. the effort has been worthwhile. my room was very large and well furnished, with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle. it had breathtaking views down michigan avenue. there is a superb recreation centre (with an impressive swimming pool) beautiful bars and a good restaurant, zest, that serves a great breakfast. there is wifi in the rooms ($9.95 per day) and tea and coffee making facilities. no trouser press, but there is an ironing board and iron. the staff is friendly and anxious to please. i recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms. it's expensive, but it will be difficult to find a better one in chicago.
truthful	i was very much looking forward to our stay at this hotel, after hearing all the good things about it. unfortunately, it was a very underwhelming experience, to say the least. but let me begin with the things that i do like about the hotel. first off, it is located my favorite part of chicago - the leafy, affluent part of town that is chicago's equivalent of manhattan's upper east side, complete with sidewalks, quiet tree-lined streets, real old-school townhouses (instead of ugly towering monstrosities that are 21st century condominiums), cute boutiques (instead of gap, banana republic and other mainstream mass-produced brands) and, of course, hermes of paris (which warrants a separate mention). i also like the small intimate lobby area with old leather couches, cherry colored wooden furnitures, area rugs and distinct artwork. the very reason why i always tend to gravitate toward smaller boutique hotels instead of impersonal chains. i definitely love the room. while the space issue is not as bad in chicago as it is in manhattan, getting a 400-sqft guestroom for our weekend getaway is not an easy task. so we were delighted to see that our room comes with generous, ample bathroom, double sink, massive king bed and still enough space to walk around, do a chicken dance, and strut my herve and louboutins in. my only reservation was the lack of natural light - the windows were definitely inadequate to allow sunlight to find its way into our 11th-floor room, but then again delaware st is not exactly the widest street in town and there are buildings in front of us, so can't have it all! yet one thing that really disappointed us was the service, or lack thereof. i mean, seriously. they don't call it the 'hospitality' industry for no reason. i did pay a premium to stay in smaller boutique hotels such as this so i do get a service that is a little bit more personalized than the kind that i would be getting from say, a 3000-room vegas hotel. first, i called in to reconfirm my reservation. the lady on the phone was anything but courteous and competent. first off, she was not able to find my reservation and i was transferred to the front desk staff, to whom i had to explain myself all over again (my pet peeve when it comes to on-the-phone customer service). the person who manned the reception desk was not friendly, nor was he at all competent either. case in point - he had to send the slip of paper on which i agree to the nightly rate and duration of stay up to the room after we checked in, which clearly indicated that he must have forgotten when we were actually down there. but the real kicker was when we ordered room service after arriving - it was about 1am. as a general rule, i am never, ever, a big fan of room service, having had my fair share of bad food that they slap 18% gratuity, 10.5% tax (and still expect a tip) on during my days globetrotting on the company's expense account. think overcooked steaks, lukewarm soup, bread hard enough to knock someone out, and ice-creams that are already half melted by the time it reaches your suite. so i really wasn't expecting hotels as small as talbott to have a 24-hour room service, but lo and behold, they do. i placed an order of chicken blt, which (to my initial delight) came in within 20 minutes. then after the customary of the invoice and the involuntary yet customary tip of $2 on top of the 18% service fee (refer above) i opened the cover only to find something that looked like it was picked up from the garbage bin, microwaved and served on a plate with a bag of lay's chips (lightly salted flavor). the bread looked like someone stomped on it, the l and t looked like it was 2 days old, the b was unrecognizable, and the chicken was burnt and cold. it was pathetic room service at its finest. we did get the item taken off our bill (rightfully so too) but the front desk person was, instead of apologetic, defiant. the whole thing was just very upsetting and for a hotel as high-end as this to be able to leave such a bad impression within the first hour of arriving, it's quite an accomplishment in and of itself. we won't be coming back, unfortunately.
truthful	i am a fan of kimpton hotels, however i have never experienced top service as i did at the hotel allegro. even before my visit, concierge mark kraemer advised us on things to see, and booked tickets in advance to second city. we were welcomed warmly on arrival, and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel. all the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience. the hotel is next to city hall, where i had some business. we had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty. and that is the only complaint i can make-from start to finish, if you want attentive service, this is the place to be. thank you, hotel allegro, for a great stay. i can't wait to return.
truthful	a great hotel, we used the cta the 2 days we were in chicago and it is great, that the line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel. so we did not need any taxi and traveled from midway to the city and to ohare for 9$ and we used the buses alot (freezing cold). the hotel itself is great, very clean rooms, realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had. staff very friendly, they even found me out were i can get timerland shoes.... and she was right i got them in one place she told me... thats service...i also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area, did not use it and i do not know if it would have been included in the room price....but realy a nice view makes running easyer....
truthful	i only stayed at this hotel for one night, the location was great but the elevators drove me crazy. after the first long wait i started to time how long it took from the moment i pushed the button until the elevator arrived, never under 10 min. even late at night. i went up to the rooftop for and after dinner drink with my husband... 1 margarita was $14! i wans't drinking because i'm pregnant so i had a soda water for $4... if i would have known i would have had tap water. overall... great rooms, ok staff , horrible elevators, overpriced drinks.
deceptive	my wife and i were very much looking forward to our stay at the hotel allegro in chicago. we had been looking forward to a romantic getaway. i have to say hotel allegro was a disappointment for both of us. this is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in. but we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given. in the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover. very shocking for the price we were paying. when we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. past this - the room itself - it has flair i guess, but i can't imagine it is the right flair for many. the colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow, designy wallpaper. neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. i can't imagine many would. it really was off-putting. overall, the experience was a check minus in my book. will not be looking to return any time soon.
deceptive	for top class treatment choose hotel allegro. in all of my years of buisness travel and vacationing, i have never been more happy with the service at a hotel than i was at hotel allegro. i searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon, and hotel allegro seemed like the right choice. soon as i walked into to their elaborate lobby area, it was like i was a big shot on wallstreet, the service was excellent and the best part, they allow animals. they treated my little dog johnny like he was royalty. they have everything you could ever need in a hotel, from in room spa service to a workout center. they even made sure that i had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the monday night bears game. if i were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10. id have to give it a 10 many times over. i highly recommend hotel allegro in chicago illinois and i will be back again.
deceptive	i had a wonderful time at the james hotel while on business in chicago. the rooms are modern, tasteful and well-kept, while the staff was responsive and efficient. this was the perfect place to unwind after working all day, but also provided an ideal atmosphere to do some more work.
truthful	i stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the chicago bears fan convention (feb 27- march 1). the hotel is beautiful. i had a towers room. i had a decent view of the city (sears tower). the room was a little small but had two bathrooms (1 king bed). the tower room has it's own registration area and comes with a free continental breakfast, evening snacks and free sodas throughout the day. the registration/ lounge is on the 24th floor and overlooks lake michigan. the hotel was full but service was excellent. the location is convenient but there are a number of homeless people within a block or two (especially toward the el train). we loved our stay at this hotel and never had to take a cab or rent a car. i will stay here again. hilton offered a sunday night free on their website with a 3 day stay. this made the cost reasonable (for chicago). however, the pavilion restaurant left a lot to be desired. the pub on the first floor was a good place to hang out and have a drink.
truthful	having stayed at the excellent affinia chain in ny, i had very high expectations. when i saw the trip advisor rating, i immediately booked. what a huge disappointment: -- the quality simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap, foam pillows -- the kind they sell in the store for $4. you cannot sleep on these -- the windows are so thin, you can hear the buzzing from walk/don't walk sign on superior below. -- the walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked, i was awaken around midnight, my room engulfed in smoke odor. a call downstairs yielded no results -- there are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood; the desk chair was full of loose threads -- the water flow is very weak, but the towels are nice -- there are unpainted floorboards, the kind you find in day's inn -- they charge for internet service the tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like. the sign outside is also a banner. having stayed all over the u.s., you are better off at red roof -- this is really an embarassment for the affinia chain. wait until they complete the renovations in 2008. i did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand. good heart, but the problems are not fixable.
truthful	this was a refreshing change from the ordinary. i loved the location, the service and the amenities offered by this hotel. the room was charming with a window seat and a water view. the decor was unique but cheerful. free wireless internet services were a plus here. the staff was helpful and attentive. we loved having goldfish share our room! i would definitely stay here again.
truthful	we booked our stay through priceline.com and got a great deal. we were only staying one night and we had our 2 year old with us. at check-in, we were upgraded to a suite with a lake view of lake michigan. it was beautiful. the suite had a king bed with a living room and a bar and mini-fridge which we didn't need, but if we were staying longer, it would have been a godsend. this hotel is in close proximity with grant park which has the beautiful buckingham fountain. we walked around the park and even saw a movie being filmed....but if you are looking for a hotel with a lot of restaurants around it, this isn't the one. we ended up eating at the irish pub inside the hotel (kitty o'shea's) which has great food. (we have stayed here before and always end up eating here.) there are a lot of attractions within a mile including the field museum, shedd aquarium, soldier field, and navy pier. they may not be walking distance but we could see them from our hotel window. overall, we had another wonderful stay at the chicago hilton. (our 4th stay) the only downside is the expensive parking within the hotel.....41 dollars a night is kind of ridiculous.
truthful	the location is ideal. they have very high ceilings so the rooms appear much larger than they are. the views are great. there were fresh flowers in the bathroom. they had all white bedding. you feel like a princess there.
truthful	we had reservations (guaranteed by credit card) for 2 nights this past weekend. when we checked in the clerk told us that they could not accommodate us for both nights because they were overbooked due to a conference in town. i asked them to relocate us for both nights so that we would not have to move in the morning. they sent us over to another location that they assured could accommodate us. the night manager gave us the address to a different hotel and sent us on our way. eventually we arrived at the correct second hotel where the staff were expecting a letter from the sheraton for the transfer - something we were never given. eventually we checked into this second property and the next afternoon when our keys didn't work we found out that the night manager of the sheraton had not assured that we could stay both nights at the second hotel. so once again we had no place to stay despite having a guaranteed reservation with the sheraton. in addition to all of this, we had to pay $24 for parking at the sheraton to find out that they would not accommodate us despite a guaranteed reservation. i am still shocked by this bad experience.
deceptive	i was highly disappointed with my choice to stay at the amalfi hotel in chicago. i had to travel for business at the last minute but felt lucky to get a reservation at such a highly rated hotel. the initial impression was that the desk clerk thought i was lucky that he was waiting on me. i had several questions about local attractions and he acted as though i was bothering him. i was the only customer in the lobby and he directed me to a rack of brochures located near the concierge then went back to leaning against the counter. on the plus side the room was lovely, but when i called for room service at 9:30pm i was told they were closed even though the menu said they served until 10pm. i decided to go out rather than fight the issue. the next day the tone was the same at the pool, the bar, the restaurant etc. the staff here seems to have a general feeling that the guests are lucky enough to stay in such a chic hotel and they are more like part of the atmosphere instead of actual employees with a job to do. the only exception was the housekeeping staff. i called them for extra pillows and another blanket and they were at my door in 10 minutes and made to ask if there was anything else i needed before leaving. the bottom line is that i booked my room here with the intention to relax for a day or two after my business was completed but decided against it. even though the hotel was beautiful and in a nice location, the atmosphere was not inviting. i'd rather go somewhere where i felt like my money was appreciated instead of staying somewhere that didn't seem to care that i was there.
truthful	stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower for 3 nights in early april 2007. very convenient location just a block from all of the shopping on the golden mile. good restaurant at the hotel serving a la carte breakfast different from the usual fare and with a nice french twist. dinner at the restaurant was also good. prices are reasonable. room is comfortable, only problem was with a card access door lock that usually required several swipes before opening. excellent service from the bellmen to the concierge and front desk staff. would definitely stay here again if visiting chicago. concierge recommended a small van tour, which was excellent. however early april is too early to visit chicago as popular activities such as the boat tour of the architecture of chicago was not operating yet.
deceptive	my three night stay at fairmont chicago millennium park was the perfect way to end a weekend. the hotel has a classy but warm atmosphere with color tones that please the mind and soothe the eyes. the staff was ready to help at any notice and always greeted you with a cheerful smile. the myspa was the getaway of a life time. my only complaint would be that the bed covers were a bit too stiff as they were new and clean but the softness of the bed whisked me away to a deep slumber in no time. well worth the money and i know my next stay will be much longer.
truthful	"avoid the talbot, especially for group functions. my in-laws spent a great deal of time trying to find just the right hotel to use for our wedding party and several out of town guests. they were lured in by promises from the talbot, that since they were a small boutique hotel that they could provide ""special, personal treatment"". nothing could have been further from the truth. they failed to honor two requests to keep the bar open after our reception, they persistently confused reservation requests, they front desk failed to contact the valet despite multiple requests and nearly caused of my guests, his wife, and his two year old daughter to miss their departing flight. now the worse part. mistakes are made, even hotel managers are human, but where a hotel, which is supposed to be in the hospitality service, can distinguish itself is in how they handle and correct the error. case in point: i had requested on several occasions when i made the reservations for my family that they all be placed under my credit card, all expenses, they assurred me that this would be no problem. of course, when my brother, his wife, and asthmatic five year old arrived to searing hot and humid chicago after six hours of travel they wouldn't let them check in until they physically saw my card... again despite them having my card on record, and despite my explaining this to them over the phone. my brother recalls the ""indignation"" of the desk clerk when he mentioned that the charges were to be put on my card. then another guest, in this case my older brother, came by and put the charges onto his card so that the five year old could escape the heat and the prolonged waiting in the lobby. when i finally was able to get across town, leaving a cubs game early, i again spoke to them about putting all the charges on my account. again they agreed, but never did anything about it. in the end when my older brother checked out on sunday he was told everything was alright, but when he went to his atm his account was frozen from ""unathorized overuse"". the hotel kept billing his debit card automatically for multiple charges ubtil his account was essentially drained. when he got home he had to take an entire day off to discuss with his bank how to rectify these events. i spent sunday afternoon for an hour and three hours on monday, the first two days of my honeymoon on the phone, calling the talbot, the credit card fraud division, my brother, etc trying to solve this situation. the most aggregious insults continued to come form the covering manager, who at one point suggested that ""i was mistaken about coming back down to talk with the desk clerk about these matters"".... this was a witnessed event, and her insinuation was that i was lying, and that there was no way her clerk could have made a mistake. in the end, there is no one running this place... managers from one department refer you to the manager of another departments voice mail. when i was finally able to get the name of the general manager (after two days)m neither he nor his assistant would ever call back. the communication between the staff and mangement is non-existant. fortuneatly the staff at the signature room (where we had the reception) was beyond excellent so the day was not lost, but the the talbot went out of its way to insult and poorly serve my family and many of our wedding guests. try the ambassador east (same neighborhood) cheaper, much more professional staff."
deceptive	this hotel allowed me to experience the best of chicago. the central downtown location was perfect for me and my boyfriend to come and go as we pleased, whether during the day or at night. it was a great get-away spot for me to relax away from work. probably one of the best beds i've ever slept on. the italian food that they served at harry carey's reminded me of when i lived in italy. overall a completely amazing experience. i can't wait to book my next stay here.
deceptive	this hotel is absolutely amazing. i have paid to stay in hotels that cost an arm and a leg only to get crappy service in return. however, here it's comfortable, friendly, and a vacation. in fact, all vacations start with your lodging, and how can you have a good vacation with poor lodging? the beds are comfortable, clean, and upscale, while still being homey enough to be relaxed. the services and staff are tops, and the view from the rooms is absolutely gorgeous! and i must commend the cleanliness! nice place to stay, and worth every penny! will definitely be coming back!
deceptive	"when i first booked my reservation at this hotel, honestly, i didn't know what to expect. i mean, i'm kind of a music person, but this was my first real experience with a musically ""themed"" hotel. upon staying here, however, i am convinced that i made the right choice in my stay. the dining accommodations were excellent, and i was served probably some of the best food i've ever eaten at a hotel. it was intelligently placed in downtown chicago, and i wouldn't have to walk too far to see some street performers, or just take in the majesty of the city itself. the room i had booked had an excellent view of the skyline, and i could've easily sat for hours, just marveling at the city sprawled out before me. the whole ""hard rock"" and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay. if i had to stay here again, i would!"
truthful	"truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid . rooms are small, dirty, and in no way represents the web sites representations. staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment. at best it is a 3 star facility ands with so many options in chicago, ""please"" avoid this one. i had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms."
truthful	i recently stayed at the sheraton for an onsite conference, and had problems from the getgo. i had problems with the check-in even though i had made arrangements beforehand to pay by company check and they have a credit card on file. the front desk clerks were kind of rude. the room was okay, not worth what i paid for. the sheets were kind of messed up and the room didn't feel very clean. they also charge for internet access, which is ridiculous. most hotels provide free wi-fi. the conference food, which i assume is catered by the hotel, was not good at all. on the day of the check out, i had arranged for a late check-out, but in the morning before check-out time, someone else got assigned to my room and was attempting to get in! then they locked me out of my room with my luggage still in there before my check out time. all in all, i would recommend staying somewhere else.
deceptive	my wife and i live in the western suburbs of chicago. for our anniversary, we booked a night at the fairmont based on recommendations from friends. while the staff of the hotel was quite friendly and helpful and the location ideal for a night out in the city, the accommodations themselves were not up to our expectations. for starters, we requested a non-smoking room which we did receive. however, the hallway leading up to our room had a distinctive smell of smoke which certainly was a turn off for both of us. while the room was certainly adequate, the bathroom light had a distinct flicker and there was no complementary shampoo included. while the latter may seem like a minor offense, it is not what one expects from hotel of such reported quality. finally, the cost of parking seemed to be somewhat inflated even for chicago's standards. in summary, the fairmont is a decent quality hotel but for the price, i am sure we could of done better.
truthful	we live down the block from the hotel. we arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away. the floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night. i think the ambassador east was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there. over the years i had had some visiting groups stay there. i had also eaten there and been to the bar but i had never stayed there myself. the lobby is elegant. the service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated. the location is the best residential area in the city (as far as i am concerned -- i live two blocks away) and it is very convenient to north michigan avenue ( a good shopping street) and reasonably convenient to the loop ( the main business area) there are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city. i paid less than $100 including tax for one night. i am not sure what their regular rates are but i think my deal was the best travel bargain around.
truthful	the best service!!! the staff here was incredible. you never had to lift a finger. the room was huge as hotel rooms go. the view was phenomenal. location great. what a great weekend. we did stop for a drink at the palm restaurant and unfortunately, it closes at 11 p.m. too bad!!! the lobby lounge is open later but drinks costs twice as much as the bar at the palm.
deceptive	my family really enjoyed this hotel the weekend we were in chicago. check in was quick and easy the staff was friendly and very helpful. the room was clean, the beds were comfortable and we had a great view of chicago. next time we come to chicago we will definitely stay here again.
truthful	we really enjoyed our brief stay at the millennium knickerbocker! from the front desk personnel and bellmen to the housekeeping staff and bartender, everyone we met was helpful and welcoming. our 11th-floor room was clean and beautiful, and the view looking north to the drake hotel and apartments across the street was nice. the in-room coffee service was appreciated, too. there isn't a lot of room in the bathroom for your toiletries, but i'd still take a room in a beautiful older hotel with character over a spacious-but-cookie-cutter room any day!
deceptive	i want everyone to know about the awful experience i had at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers. when we arrived at the hotel, the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system (i had called earlier in the day and confirmed it). after speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked. we later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically. i believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money. i for one won't be going back to this hotel!
deceptive	the talbott hotel is fantastic! i stayed there on business and found that it met my every need. the high speed internet access worked flawlessly; allowed me to do much of my work from the comfort of my luxuriously appointed room. i really like to exercise before a day of meetings; access to the fitness club next door was very convenient. last point: i work for a green consulting firm out of l.a. and the hotel's environmental credentials dovetailed perfectly with our mission. guilt free luxury!
truthful	we stayed in the conrad for 4 nights just before thanksgiving. we had a corner room overlooking n michigan av and the tribune building. to say this is a 5 star hotel is to damn this place with faint praise - it is wonderful. the staff were unbelievably helpful. the standard of the room was superb - hd plasma screens, luxury bedlinens, ipod radio, huge bathroom. location is unbeatable - right in the heart of everything - watched the whole light festival parade from the window. breakfasts were excellent - no help yourself buffet here - with full and attentive table service. would have no hesitation recommending or staying again in this hotel - 5 out of 5.
truthful	spent three nights in chicago at this property. first of all, i have to say that it would be hard to imagine a better location as it is perfectly situated on the magnificent mile close to terrific restaurants, the art institute and orchestra hall. the hotel has two sides - the historic tower and a new wing. the rooms are larger on the historic side but generally are looking a little tired. this property needs to be renovated. some observations: the junior suite i had was laid out strangely. a small bedroom and smaller sitting room separated by a corridor off of which was the very large bathroom. the mirror over the sink was not over the sink but skewed to the right - made shaving a challenge and messy. while descending in the elevator one morning, it started shaking so violently that i could barely stand up. it stopped on the 11th floor and i was greeted by an extremely worried looking hotel employee who had a technician shut it down. (this experience was far more powerful than coffee in helping me wake up - an adrenaline rush certainly cures sleepiness!) reports from my group were of sinks stopped up, exposed bolts in rooms, and generally things not working. now the good news - the staff is terrific. they make you feel welcome, are personable, have their own personalities, great service in the bar and really went the extra distance to help. i wish they had a better property to work in.
truthful	"my husband and i stayed overnight at the affinia. prior reviews led us to believe this was a quality hotel; not true. since it was a very special occasion, and also because we were only staying overnight, we didn't let the shabbiness and poor service of the hotel ruin our weekend. however, this would have qualified as one of the poorest hotel experiences. i've ever had. first, the smells: the linens and pillows on our bed smelled moldy and mildewy. the odors were not mild, and i found it pretty repulsive. i couldn't wait to jump out of bed in the morning, to get away from the odors. hard to sleep and certainly didn't want to be in the bed any longer than absolutely necessary. i didn't discover how disgusting the bed smelled until around midnight when we got into bed. at that point, i chose not to contact housekeeping because (a) i was exhausted, and (b) i didn't want to upset my husband, who had fallen immediately to sleep after a long day of sightseeing. also, the bathroom smelled like vinegar. perhaps this is the cleaning agent used by affinia, but the odor should have dissipated over the course of our stay and it never did. incidentally, the bathroom floor tiles and wallpaper looked like they had seen better days; not a well-maintained property. second, the elevators: if you stay above the first few floors, there are only two elevators that run from ground level to the rooftop c-view bar. with so many floors to service, and so many people going up to the c-view bar on a saturday, these elevators took forever to come, and were often full they did. annoying. also, on one occasion, there were several bottles (water and soda) left in the elevator; clearly, the maintenance crew doesn't inspect and clean the common areas frequently. finally, and perhaps the most disappointing was the service when we arrived. first, when we booked, we asked for as quiet a room as possible. the hotel is located near northwestern memorial hospital. but, its proximity to michigan ave., and the lack of accomodations elsewhere (due to the transformers movie filming and a big international convention taking place the same week-end), led us to stay here anyway. at check-in, the clerk noted our request, and said our room was quiet room since it was not ""next to the elevators."" when we arrived at our room, we discovered that we were across from the elevators. obviously, she was technically correct that we weren't next to the elevators, but it was still so close (15-20 feet) that we could hear the elevator noise. also, since it was a special occasion, we asked if we could upgrade. the disingenuous, snarky, condescending clerk told us that checking in early was an upgrade. clearly, the woman has not travelled enough to know that in many quality hotels, this is a matter of routine, not exception. pretty awful experience all the way around. other reviewers must have very low expectations. can't explain any of the good reviews otherwise."
truthful	"my significant other and i recently spent 3 nights at the james and on the last day i said, ""i wish we could stay longer"". that good! the room was immaculate and a very pleasant surprise from the moment you open the door. everything is high tech. plasma tv, cd/radio, projection alarm clock (love that so much bought one today). if you wanted room service you got it from david burke and the mini bar and liquor selection was plentiful. they even have a four legged friend menu. the bathroom was pleasant with bathrobes/slippers and upscale products provided. the bed was the best in a hotel ever. linens were crip, white and fresh. maid service twice daily with turn down service. safe in room, ice delivered, iron, hairdryer all top of the line. the filtered window shades blacked out the light and matched the modern decor. mid-century style with funky chair/ottman, cubes and a table with nightstands gave us plenty of room and felt like comforts of home. the staff was courteous and accommodating. the library, free internet access, in room wifi were extras we didn't expect . bar/lounge areas seems to be frequented by locals enjoying cocktails and appetizers in the lobby. funky artwork. location, location, location. the best place we've ever stayed not only in chicago. highly recommend."
truthful	i have never experienced terrible service like this especially at such a highly rated hotel. i had booked the hotel room for my parents for their anniversary weekend and stopped by earlier in the week to have the charge for the room put on my card as a gift. when my parents arrived, they were told that the front desk staff was new and did not complete the charge correctly. my parents then had to charge their own anniversary trip. additionally, my father had requested a non-smoking room to stay in and was reassured 3 times that his room was non-smoking. when my parents got to the room it reeked of smoke and there was an ashtray and matches on the desk tabletop. when my father caled down to the front desk to ask about this the guy at the front desk asked if my dad wanted him to come up and remove the ashtray and matches - something that would clearly not resolve the fact that they were put in a smoking room after being reassured 3 times that the room was non-smoking. never again.
truthful	i read the reviews on trip advisor for this property which had it ranked as #1 in chicago. i got a king room overlooking michigan ave. the view was beautiful. the room was also impeccable. nice and bright, very fresh and modern. i find it very hard to fault any sofitel's. the service, attentiveness of staff, cleanliness and luxury are always top notch. location was great, head left from the lobby and you reach a bunch of european style cafe's and restaurants. straight ahead of the hotel on michigan ave is a shoppers paradise. a great place to stay, and much better value than park hyatt. i do find some of the charges in luxury hotels to be a bit crazy, such as for the internet. when you are paying top dollar, a few inclusions would be nice.
truthful	we had an issue with housekeeping and the hotel management did not handle it well. they were subject to a brief staff strike and did not inform guests and in fact failed to tell us about the strike and our room never was cleaned. after 4 calls and several hours we were able to get clean towels. overall service other than check in was poor for a reportedly 4 star hotel.
truthful	"i took the wife and kids to chicago for one last fling before school started back up. when i checked in, the staff was very attentive, i showed a little consideration for the friendly attitude (small tip) and was upgraded to a huge upper floor room complete with a bar! i didn't get the ""priceline"" glare and it paid off for all involved. the air and water show was underway on the lake front, and we had planes flying over our room. the kids thought it was great. that night we had a great view of the fireworks at navy pier. the sunday morning breakfast buffet at the hotel was very good and the price was not out of reason. the conceirge was very knowledgeable and very friendly. it was one of the best times we ever had in chicago."
deceptive	while staying at the swissotel chicago i experienced some of the worst customer service i have at any hotel. the front desk was extremely rude while checking out, and even seemed to try to hurry us out. the fitness center was always packed and i was never able to get on any of the machines, as was the pool area. while eating at the restaurant, i felt it was a very overpriced meal, but it was very elegant looking. the last issue i had with the hotel was the valet parking, it took them awhile to get my car, and they actually pulled the wrong car around. it was another 10 minutes while i waited for them to sort the issue out. the worst part by far was the customer service, and although the hotel looked nice, it wasn't worth the stay with the way i felt i was treated based on the money i was spending. next time we are in chicago, we will be staying somewhere else!
deceptive	we enjoyed our stay at the swissotel in downtown chicago. it was elegant, classy, and the service was impeccable. it was very family friendly for us, with the spacious rooms, the kid's room, and the no smoking policy. we were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see. the food was delicious and we didn't have to go outside the hotel to find good food. when visiting chicago again, we will come back. it was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price. linda davies
deceptive	everything experienced at this hotel was grand. the hotel itself is stunning and the architecture is amazing. from the moment you walk into the palmer house, you are greeted by friendly helpful staff. the rooms are out of this world with no detail overlooked. comfortable beds, amazing bathrooms and breathtaking views of chicago. if you are looking for an extravagant hotel for your next visit to the windy city, i would definately recommend you stay here. experience chicago like never before.
truthful	we stayed here as an alternative spot for a friend's wedding. the price was about 50% to 65% of what it costs to stay at similar hotels in the area. first the minuses. 1.) the standard rooms are small. if you want a little more space you might want to upgrade. 2.) since the hotel has been recently rehabbed you can see some of the stuff that the covered or painted. 3.) there really are no views from the hotel. now the plusses. 1.) the shower is awesome. probably one of the best hotel showers i've seen. rain shower with wand, great pressure and the enclosure didn't leak like a lot of these shower stalls do. very nice. 2.) the fixtures and finishes in the rooms were top notch. very modern and clean. 3.) the bed was great. better than some hotels that promote their beds. great nights sleep. overall. this is a great space for a trip where you are not going to be spending much time in the room. if you were in town for a conference or for work where you will need to spread out your stuff it might not work. anyone else should really like the experience. all i care about when i travel is having a nice bed and a good shower to relax in after a long day. if you are the same this is a good spot for you.
truthful	had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the palmer house. the service was wonderful, staff was very friendly towards dog owners, even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was. easy access to red line from midway. valets were prompt at retrieving car (they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting).
truthful	we stayed at the fairmont two saturday's in a row, and both stays were disappointing. we had to call the hotel prior to each stay and both times it took the hotel 30-40 minutes to answer their phone. for the price, we expected nicer decor (it looked cheaply done); more comfortable beds-the mattresses were too soft and the sheets too hard-pillows weren't comfortable either; a more accomodating front desk staff. our friends who were also there on the same dates will undoubtably add similar comments.
deceptive	i was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at affinia chicago! when i arrived to check in, my reservation that i had made, (and confirmed), 2 weeks earlier, was not in the computer.i had to wait 40 minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me. the whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non-stop on her cell phone, while the office phone rang off the hook. i had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room.i'll never go back,dont waste your money.
deceptive	the sheraton chicago hotel and towers was an awesome place to stay. nothing bad about it. it was a great value. the beds were comfortable, the rooms were nice and open, and the pool was great. food was great! my family and i loved staying here! would recommend to everyone i know.
deceptive	when i planned my summer vacation, i was wanting to travel somewhere new. chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life. i got in a flight to chicago and arrived at the hard rock hotel. it was grand and i spent a total of 4 days and nights there. the luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues. the room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious, i could hardly picture not feeling satisfied. i met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town. i enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later.
deceptive	this hotel is rather far from the airport and in traffic it took almost 2 hours to get there. by that time, i was so tired i was just ready to check in to my room. i stood in line forever as there was only one person working at the front desk. that was only the beginning. it was very noisy outside from people constantly walking around. i guess it's because they're located in the middle of the downtown area, but they could at least make the walls thicker. i don't want to hear everything going on in my neighbor's room. the bathroom was not very clean and one of the towels had a hole in it. the toilet ran all night which kept me up along with all the people on the street. the restaurant food was horrible and i would rather buy food from a street vendor than to pay the ridiculously high price they charged for a burger. overall, i was very disappointed with my stay at the conrad chicago.
truthful	we just returned from 4 nights at the ambassador east. what a gem! the location in the gold coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the magnificent mile. there is a train station about 2 blocks away. the room was very comfortable, with nice amenities, and there is free internet service on the 2nd floor. best of all was the bell and lobby staff! they really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived. i would say that this was the nicest hotel staff i've encountered in all my travels.
deceptive	extremely disappointed in our stay. this hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online. i booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be, only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for. the room smelled musty and not clean. garbage was not changed from prior person. found small ants in bathroom near shower. called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray. overall this hotel is in a great location, but we would never visit again. staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online.
deceptive	the intercontinental chicago is conveniently located near midway airport so the commute was short and easy. the room had a great view of a lake. room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great i did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee. there was a business center that had internet, fax machines, and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day. one of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs, it was exactly what i needed, very relaxing. the food at the eno was some of the best i ever ate especially the chocolate, i never wanted to leave. this was a great hotel experience and i would stay there again.
truthful	took a weekend trip with my wife. got a great rate with valet included, paid a couple extra bucks for the larger room. staff was nice, workout facility was great. room has current decor, but was starting to show some wear. watch the concierge, she suggested a pretty bad restaurant to us.
truthful	just back from a business trip. the homewood is in a great location just off the magnificent mile, includes a great breakfast, heavy hors d'ouevres for dinner with beer and all for a pre-paid rate of $129. without a doubt the best value in chicago for a long, long time.
deceptive	fantastic hotel! upscale and luxurious, and in a great location! rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty! the rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean, the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for! my husband and i had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities. i would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone, and can't wait to get back there myself!
deceptive	for the amount of money per night that the millennium knickerbocker hotel charges, one would at least expect a room with a working bathroom. the toilet wouldn't flush, the sink dripped and the towels were rough and cheap looking. when i called the front desk to ask for maintenance on the sink and toilet, the staff were indifferent. it was over an hour before anyone arrived to fix the bathroom fixtures, and when they did arrive they were unable to stop the drip in the sink. all in all, i was disappointed with my stay.
deceptive	the hyatt regency chicago hotel offered pda or kiosk check-in which was great. they also offer hypo-allergenic rooms with air purification systems which gave us a much more delightful stay. we enjoyed the 24/7 stay fit gym, ihome stereo with ipod docking station, flat screen tv with video on demand and wi-fi. concierge staff was very helpful with assisting us with finding excellent award winning dining and popular attractions in the area. we enjoyed our stay and will definetly return to this hotel in the future for family and business trips.
deceptive	my stay at the sofitel was great. i loved the location it was in. from the moment i arrived the experince was great, the attendants were helpful and the front desk was too. i thought the room was elegant and very clean as well as comfortable. the room service was excllent and they were very friendly. checkout was a breeze and i couldnt ask for anything more in a hotel stay.
truthful	over all, my trip was great; i got to spend time with my best friend. we did some shopping and site seeing. trip was overall great. the only thing was our hotel stay was not up to speed with other luxury hotels i have stayed at. some of the walls had wall paper missing, most of the faucets leaked, there was water stains on the ceiling in the bathrooms, some of the furniture had very visible stains, the fire alarm was coming off the wall in the main bedroom. we stayed in the corner suite on the 37 floor room 3711. considering what ones pays for the room you would think the pool would be free and they would not charge for every single small amenity. i do not plan on staying there again. apart from the trip was great![]
deceptive	i only stayed here for five days, but i will definitely never be going back. the architecture is kind of cool, but the customer service was very poor. i don't know how much these people get paid, but they must not think it is enough. breakfast at the the continental was alright, but it was overpriced. this hotel felt really crowded and the service was impersonal. there are many better places to stay in chicago.
truthful	this is a stunning hotel in an excellent location in the greatest of us cities. the entrance and lobby of the hotel indicates its class. the bedrooms are large and comfortable and the customer service is second to none. it is located on south michigan directly across the road from grant and millenium park. it also has a free shuttle to the water tower in the heart of the magnificent mile. for blues fans, buddy guy's legends club is situated immediately behind the hotel. highly recommended.
deceptive	this hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of chicago. it is ideal for the corporate executive. not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean. the dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience. while dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city, which is picturesque especially at night, when the city lights come on. the rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area. i would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive!
truthful	great place, great room, great location. even though there was a big meeting going on (rainbow girls in all their enormous gowns) the only consequence for us was slow elevators. ballroom is amazing, shops on ground floor a nice throwback. lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 i think -- are worth it. concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent. definitly would return.
deceptive	the hilton chicago, located on prime real estate in downtown chicago, has not aged as gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time. the hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic, but that luxury is not in accord with 21st century standards. lacking any form of fitness center, the hilton is almost alone among the major hotels of chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a quick workout. even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this point, and the outrageous parking fee of $43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making the hilton their destination. most guest rooms are no different than any other hilton anywhere, meaning that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic executive suites, you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience.
deceptive	i had an awful experience here. the staff were rude and unhelpful. it took forever to check in and when i did, they took a while to even find my reservation. when i got to the room, it was marginally clean and when i complained, they said they were full and could not do anything for me. i would never go back. they are obviously not worried about customer service.
deceptive	not one of my better experiences, when i first arrived at the hotel and tried to get my room key it was discovered that they were fresh out of keys. i had to wait half an hour while someone ran out to get more keys. it wouldn't have been as bad but the lobby looked to be in slight disrepair. when i finally got to the room i found the burnt out light bulb and an unmade bed. the room was an ok size for one person but any more than that and it would probably get a bit crowded. but the view from the window was amazing, and it took away some of the bad for me. overall, it just felt like the owners of the hotel stopped caring, maintenance took four or so hours to finally come fix the light. i didn't even get housekeeping my entire stay there. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone in the area, hopefully it will make them get their act together.
truthful	beautifully appointed, professionally staffed, comfortable, well-located, and elegant, with wireless internet access (plus free access in an alcove on the second floor), fitness center (a little small but fine if you use it at the right time), good energy clientele, easy access to michigan avenue, next door to 24-hour restaurant, 2 blocks from 2 starbucks, elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything. will definitely return!
deceptive	i have heard friends talking about the hotel monaco in chicago and did have my doubts at first. however when i arrived there was amazed at the location! it is near so many shopping places, museums, theatre, and many others places. was in town for visiting old family and friends so did not plan to stay in room for long, however the room was still amazingly clean and well kept entire 6 day stay. fell asleep quick in the beds and woke up ready for another day! the staff at the place is amazing i even got very good directions from them as sadly didnt know the area too well and had plans to meet people. one day did spend the day in room recovering from a long night and the room service was the best i have ever had at a hotel. all and all was highly impressed of this hotel good room, good service, and was able to have great time with friends and family by bringing them there and places nearby, will be heading back to this hotel many times.
deceptive	downtown chicago has a multitude of available hotels. however once youve decided to step away from the ordinary a fantastic way to get away from it all is by booking a stay at the homewood suites. the combination of luxury and affordability is evident as soon as youve entered the glamourous lobby. the downtown homewood suites is located near all the attractions which make chicago the diverse and culturally rich town that is world known. the hotel offers a free fitness center, high speed wireless internet as well as a complimentary buffet breakfast. being a member of the hilton family ensures the utmost in quality and service which has been observed by millions of customers around the world.
deceptive	i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a total of three days, and through out my stay i had a wonderful time. the room was impeccably clean, as well as the pillows and sheets. the beds were large and extremely comfortable. the staff though, in my honest opinion, is what made my stay so pleasant. from the people at the check in, to the waiters at the restaurant, i got the best customer service. the hotel was also conveniently located. it was within walking distance to the shopping center. i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in chicago.
truthful	not a good start when the front desk isn't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room! we reserved a king suite, and the hotel put us in a queen suite without telling us up front. only after we confronted the manager did they come clean about the switch, he offered us a free breakfast, but would not up-grade our room. the whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the omni. we will not be retuning to this hotel again.
deceptive	"the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice, but it certainly does not ""exceed expectations"" as touted on their website. their starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler. ""chic but not fussy"" is an overstatement. the room was clean, although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it hadn't been cleaned since the last guest. there was hand lotion and shampoo samples, but no soap sample. the bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed. ""cheap"" might have been a better adjective. check out was simple and not much hassle. overall, the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is fine in a pinch, but next time, i will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room."
deceptive	the talbot hotel is an elegant place to take you wife or husband for a weekend getaway. the personally yours romantic package was fabulous. upon check in we opened our room door and found a romantic atmosphere. there was rose pedals and luxurious bathrobes. we felt like it was our honey moon all over again.
truthful	i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror. they admitted it was their fault, and now they won't pay the $500 to fix it because we can't prove it was not broken before!!! the hotel is wonderful, the rooms are new and nice, but we will never stay here again because of this....be sure to inspect your car before you leave!
truthful	if you love brick walls and alleyways, then this view is for you. i asked for a room facing the river, i get a room facing a brick wall. that really pissed me off. from all the great reviews, i was expecting better. before i came here, i stayed in a hyatt in nyc, and that was awesome. there was nothing about the hotel that blew me away. the wine hour was ok. i was hoping there would be something better food, but i guess that's why it's a wine hour. i ordered room service one night. there wasn't really anywhere to eat it, so i had to eat it on my bed to watch tv. this was my first time coming to chicago, and i think it will be my last. just thoroughly disappointed.
truthful	just wanted to let everyone know if you are looking for a hotel with high rise construction next door the swissotel chicago is the one for you. my wife and i went there last year and there was just an empty lot next door, this year there is a loud construction site next door. so 8 am saturday morning you will hear the workers starting. i am sure once the summer in chicago comes around they will work all night. just think as they keep adding floors you will be able to look the workers in the eye and wave from your room that used to have a view of the navy pier. now you will get an up close and personal view of people pouring concrete. on top of it the hotel is doing construction of there own. the front of the hotel is block and lucky for us the protestors that are standing in front of the hotel were able to tell use where the new entrance was. the protestors were there because the swissotel hired a company to redo their sound system that does not hire union workers. if you ask the workers about the noise and they say we can't hear it. i am sure the swissotel does not want word getting out about this. if you insist on trying it for yourself don't pay for your room in advance they will not let you out of the room and then you are stuck.
deceptive	a decent place to stay. the people are nice enough, yet the atmosphere was not what i was expecting. the rooms were not very spacious, nor welcoming. so many places to eat, yet the food was very pricey and average. i would stay here again possibly, but i feel like i could find a better option for a better price.
deceptive	i recently stayed at the sofitel hotel (chicago water tower), and i was quite disappointed. i was excited by the great location (on east chestnut street downtown), but this was a mediocre hotel for the price ($250 per night before taxes). the view from my room was of the top of a parking garage and some dumpsters, and yes, the view of downtown in the distance was pretty, but i was very disappointed. the bedding seemed to be polyester, not the luxury cotton many lower-level hotels are featuring lately. when i ordered room service at 10:30 (on a thursday night), i had to wait for 55 minutes, 20 minutes longer than i was quoted. i ordered a salad, and i thought the lettuce was a bit limp as if it had been sitting out for too long. overall, i was very disappointed by my overpriced stay at the sofitel chicago water tower.
deceptive	i went to the homewood suites in chicago which is part of hilton's famous hotels. i gotta say that this is the worst hotel that i have ever been to. in fact, homewood suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet. i checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape. in fact, the rooms looked so bad that i wanted to leave the hotel early. i also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel. i saw one of the employees and when i rung the bell for my room, they ignored me. how could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you? one more thing that i hate about this hotel is that the logo didn't look like the actual logo. it looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw. i'll never go to this hotel again and it won't even be in a million years for that matter. this is a hotel that i will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer.
truthful	under the gloss of a nice building, friendly staff, and a wild set of items in the minibar, this is somewhat below-average hotel. in particular, the bed and chairs were some of the least comfortable i ever encountered. after two nights, my wife and i were practically cripped by bed pain. we complained to the staff and were immediately offered the chance to switch to a different room, but the other room was furnished identically. the owners of the omni need to stop spending money on bath salts for the rooms and invest in the basic comforts. i should not be lying on the floor, trying to unkink my back, thinking longingly of the last red roof inn i visited.
truthful	this place is a dump. i booked on priceline, because the last time i booked a priceline hotel in chicago, i got the westin and loved it. despite having paid for priceline, i ate the money i had already spent and called for a reservation at the westin and went there for the weekend, instead. i didn't regret it for a second. you will be disappointed if you stay at the millenium knickerbocker because you are paying for a holiday inn at the price of a westin when you could have the real deal for just a little more. the location is not worth the place being old and so unimpressive. there are enough hotels near the loop (and near a train/bus stop if you need to move around the city inexpensively) that you should not spend the money on the millenium. do not waste your time and stay here--this is a trap because of its location, but it's not worth it. really.
truthful	we recently celebrated our 20th anniversary in chicago and stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers. having looked at a gizillion places i chose this one because of its location to navy pier. (we were going on a dinner cruise-the odyssey at navy pier) the hotel is a short walk...unless you are wearing heels:) to navy pier. we found out on the way home only a $5 cab ride:) worth $20 to your blisters!! its also only a short walk to michigan ave shopping...for comfortable shoes perhaps?? i chose this hotel because of location, but the views are also terrific. this time we had a lake view of navy pier, but our previous trip we had a river and lake view. both very nice. the hotel is very nice. several restaurants, although we haven't tried them. the burger place downstairs sure smelled good though:) we ended up at bubba gumps at navy pier. good! the rooms were very spacious and clean!! i am kind of a germaphobe! so clean is important for my sanity:) the bottom level has doors that leads right out to the riverwalk, and a cool water fountain. :) i obviously highly recommend this hotel:) i <3 chicago
deceptive	i was genuinely surprised by my stay at this hotel. the walls were paper thin, and i could hear conversations in the next room. this is not something i would have expected from a higher class of hotel. the room was also smaller than i would have expected for the price. we were given minimal toiletries and towels in the guest room, something which made it difficult for two people to get ready in the morning. we requested new towels, but it took an entire day for them to get around to fulfilling our request. the check-in process was frustrating, mostly due to the unhappy clerk behind the counter. i don't know if she was having a bad day, or just happens to be in such a mood all the time, but either way, it was unpleasant and a pain to deal with. overall, not a pleasant experience. i think next time, we'll choose another hotel to stay at when visiting chicago.
deceptive	"when i walked into the millennium knickerbocker hotel, my first thought was ,""wow this is very yellow"", and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day, no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse. my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in. it was a victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms. i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms."
deceptive	staying at the hard rock hotel is one of best bets you can ever make while traveling. i stayed at this one the last time i visited chicago and it was just wonderful. the rooms are amazing and the one i stayed in had a great view of the city. the beds were comfortable and everything was really clean and neat, the wi-fi was really fast and always available and i liked the fact that you could get a guitar at the front desk and jam in your own room with a pair of headphones. i didn't have the chance to use the spa, but i could tell it was really nice and relaxing. i did go to the base bar a couple times for a drink, very cool atmosphere and great drinks to choose from. the rock shop was pretty cool too and i bought a bunch of shirts to bring back home to family and friends. overall i think this is one of the coolest hotels you could stay in, the experience is definitely different than any other hotel i've stayed in.
truthful	this hotel is totally overrated. yes, the location is awesome, but there are plenty of other nearby hotel options. the customer service, or lack thereof, was particularly disappointing. why are they paying anywhere from 2 - 8 doormen yet none of them can ever actually open the door for a lady? even when her hands are full. the housekeeping staff couldn't figure out our preferences even after we left them a daily note explicitly stating such along with a tip -every day. why ask what newspaper we want with our morning room service when you don't bring it anyway. as stated previously, the location is great. location, however, does not make up for the complete lack of customer service and inattentiveness from staff. i would not stay here again.
deceptive	the amalfi hotel has a beautiful website and interior decorating, but that's about it. when my wife and i got here, we were given keys to a room that had not even been cleaned! the internet access promised on the hotel's website was down, so i couldn't catch up on any of the business i had intended to do, and my wife thought that the dark design details in the room made her feel claustrophobic, like she was sleeping inside a salvador dali painting. all in all, this hotel was not worth the money, especially since we spent most of our time enjoying the city--something more casual and comfortable would have been better, and it would probably have been cleaner, too!
deceptive	"my experience at the amalfi hotel in chicago was not very pleasant. when we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our ""experience designer"" who was not the friendliest of people. also, me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed. for the price, i would have expected a more luxurious experience."
truthful	my $200 gucci sunglasses were stolen out of my bag on the 16th. i filed a report with the hotel security and am anxious to hear back from them. this was such a disappointment, as we liked the hotel and were having a great time in chicago. our room was really nice, with 2 bathrooms. we had 2 double beds and a comfortable hideaway bed. we had a great view of the lake and park. the hotel charged us $25 to check in early (10am).
truthful	i stayed at the swissotel for a business trip the first week of aug 2007. i arrived late the first night and got shoved into a hospitality room the first night. however, this was more than made up when after a strong talk they assigned me a corner room on the 28th floor. excellent view of the city, river and lake michigan. in fact, i would say the corner room of the swissotel has a better view than any other hotel in the vicinity. the room was huge, and everything was clean and the bathroom was nice. the hotel is very convieniently located to the magnificient mile and millenium park. would very much recommend this hotel, and would suggest trying every method possible to get a corner room in a higher floor.
deceptive	traveled to this hotel on a family vacation. we chose this hotel because it was pet friendly. upon arrival we smelled just how pet friendly it was! the dog that greets you attacked my dog. there was constant barking throughout the night and during breakfast, i found hair in my eggs! i would not recommend this hotel!
deceptive	when i first checked the hotel's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there. but i was totally disappointed once i got there, first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one, it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that. then when i was trying to enjoy the view, they windows were all dusty and dirty. so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse!. i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww!, its all i can say about this hotel.
deceptive	i stayed two nights at the hilton chicago. that was the last time i will be staying there. when i arrived, i could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. they wanted at least $10. what am i paying for when i stay there for the night? the website also touted the clean linens. the room was clean and i believe the linens were clean. the problem was with all of the down pillows etc. don't they know that people have allergies? i also later found out that this hotel allows pets. i think that this was another part of my symptoms. if you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks i suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. i did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. beware hidden costs. i will try somewhere else in the future. not worth the money or the sneezing all night.
truthful	we stayed at the hard rock on january 27th, 2009 for $125/night. it is located on michigan ave, just two blocks from the mag mile, two blocks from millenium park, and five blocks from the chicago art institute. our hotel room was very nice with views of michigan ave and a unusually comfy bed. the hotel even offered free coffee in the lobby every morning and free wifi in the rooms. parking was $45 for valet and $30 for self parking. the staff was very helpful with all of our request.
deceptive	you made chicago a wonderful stay! the room was gorgeous! i came with very little on hand and my deluxe room supplied me with everything that i needed, i didn't even have to ask! thank you so much, i will be back! very tidy room as well!
deceptive	i recently stayed at the affina chicago hotel and was really dissappointed. when i arrived, the desk clerk was really slow checking me in. i feel like turtles could have checked me in faster. i was finally checked in and my room was on the 8th floor. the elevator ride seemed to take forever. i arrived and the room and at first glance it looked great, but after looking everything over there were finger smudges on the glass table. i figured maybe room cleanin must have accidentally touched it. i went to the c-house for supper that evening and i had to wait for what seemed like forever. the meal was good, but my waitress was very uptight. on my way back to my room, i asked the front desk to set up a wake up call for 6 am the next morning and they were very grateful to set that up. it would have been nice to actually get it though. the next morning i surprisingly work up at 7:18 am and realized that i had not received a wake up call. i was very upset and let them know. overall this experience was not worth the 4 stars that this hotel has been given. for the price, quality and ratings the affina chicago hotel has been given, i would expect better service.
truthful	i have stayed at the palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok. the main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center, which is truly annoying. in addition, there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator. other than that, it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm. but, the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable. the door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk, and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed. there was no room for them to put the tv in front of the bed, so they shoved it off to the side. room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and i promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel. it should not be sold as a hotel room.
truthful	my wife and i stayed for 2 nights and loved it. our stay was booked for us by virgin atlantic when we booked our flights from london to chicago. we were not quite sure what to expect but were reassured by the hilton brand name. in the event we found that the airline knew what they were doing when they suggested this hotel. on arrrival we got a warm welcome and the check in was quick and efficient. the interior of the hotel is spectacular and looks like has been refurbished to reflect the decor as it would have been when it was built. the room we were given was a good size with 1 queen bed which was particularly comfortable. the hotel is conveniently located with restaurants nearby. the first night we ate at the hotel's own gourmet restaurant (the lockwood) which did not disappoint. the breakfasts are also served in this restaurant. we had the buffet both mornings and these were good value for the quality offered. generally we found the service in this hotel good and the staff very helpful. a nice touch was that when we checked out of the hotel to go to our next destination the car we had booked to pick us up was a few minutes late arriving. a member of staff supervising the doormen saw us looking a bit lost and came over to assist us find the car when it did arrive. overall i would thoroughly recommend this hotel for both business and leisure stays for both quality and value for money.
truthful	i stayed in a deluxe king suite. no desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals. the only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table (!) and canted forward. incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer. since my room was configured like all the other deluxe king suites depicted in on line photos, i have to assume this design flaw with the couch/futon runs throughout the property. bed was fine and bath was fine but i can't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well. the couch/futon seating is the worst i've encountered in a modern hotel.
truthful	our stay at the ambassador east hotel was extremely relaxing and pleasant. we enjoyed the location. we could easily walk to the red line or access the bus lines along michigan avenue. we felt safe walking along the neighborhood streets and viewing the fabulous architecture that is on n. state street and dearborn. we walked to 3rd coast cafe, the chicago history museum, and second city from our hotel. our room was spacious and well-kept, and it was quiet enough for us to take a nap during the afternoon before heading out again in the evening. we would choose to stay there again even if we could afford more expensive locations downtown. we definitely enjoyed the neighborhood feel of the place.
deceptive	"i visited the hotel allegro chicago while i was on vacation with my daughter. i booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. i was particularly excited there was a fitness center because i work out on a regular basis and i would not have to give that up on my vacation. let me start by saying the staff was very rude and i was very dissappointed they could not respect that i was very tired after traveling a very long way. i booked the hotel stay for over a week, which was very expensive, and that seemed to not matter to them at all, despite that fact that i was travelling with a small child as well! they did nothing to accommodate me, and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she ""didn't know the area"" to tope it all off, the fitness center was under construction so i never got to use it. worst hotel experience of my life, i will never go back. - sandy d."
truthful	this lovely hotel has only six floors, making it easy to get to elevators and down to reception. the building is dwarfed amongst all the skyscrapers around it. trump's huge new tower is just down the street. the amalfi looks recently refurbished, very modern, but warm and inviting. bedrooms quite spacious with lovely linens and very, very comfortable beds. bathroom quite small but roomy enough, with aveda tolietries and constant hot water in the showers. continental style breakfast is set out fresh every morning in front of the elevator of every floor. great to stumble out of bed and grab a coffee etc (robes & slippers provided) without having to get dressed for a formal breakfast. really enjoyed the managers evening cocktail reception, especially the amalfitinis. a nice way to relax after a hard days' shopping! location is great for all the shops, transport, museums etc. easy walking to everywhere. staff also very friendly and welcoming. would definately stay there again.
truthful	"very disappointed in our stay in chicago monoco. we have stayed many times elsewhere, primarily in washington dc and are accustomed to great customer service, beverages like water or soda at the wine bar, coffee and papers in the morning, help with bags. not only did the chicago monoco do none of these things, the staff was not helpful, either. requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there. you got the feeling you were ""bothering"" people if you asked a question. no bellman, the doorman did not open the door or help with bags. even though we were traveling with a child, i had to request a fish when they did not bring it. really baffling.. as we love the monoco in washington."
truthful	i stayed at the james in june, and i must say, it felt like i was in some ultra-swanky boutqiue hotel. from the uniforms of the staff.. which consists of a small j pin that they wear with nice suits and such, to the wonderful, comfortable beds, the james just makes you feel ultra-relaxed. the gym in the hotel was fantastic for a hotel gym, and the machines were all new and in fantastic condition. i really enjoyed the complimentary kiehl's products as well as the soft, cushy beds with futons. location-wise, it's just off michigan ave, and it's close to all the shops and restaurants. i'd definitely stay here if i'm' ever back in chicago.
truthful	this is my second time here in two months; both stays were great. the rooms are very nice and very clean. the staff is terrific and always attentive. my only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk.
deceptive	my experience with the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was terrible! i arrived exactly at my check in time only to be told my room would not be ready for another hour. i chose to wait patiently at the hotel bar and found myself again disappointed i sat for 15 minutes before the bar tender served me and the drink i received was warm. when the room was finally ready i was horrified to find hairs in the bathtub and mysterious spots on the bedding. when i called down to housekeeping the staff was very rude and maid who they sent up to change my sheets acted annoyed and muttered under her breath the whole time she was changing our sheets and cleaning the bathroom. after all this hassle i would normally expect at least a complimentary beverage but not only was that not offered i found even using internet at this location involved a rather exorbitant fee 13.95 for a 24 hour period. i was shocked having stayed at a variety of higher end hotels i have never once been asked to pay extra for my wifi access. overall i was highly disappointed with my stay and will not be returning to the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel any time soon.
truthful	arrived at 1:30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel. if you party and stay out all night anyway, this hotel would be fine. but don't plan to get any rest if the club is open! front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while i was checking in. she was fine with me and gave me a corner room, but sure wouldn't want to be on her bad side.
deceptive	when i had to visit chicago for business i asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the hotel allegro. after my stay i can honestly say that i agree. from the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities, everything was thought of. the only place i find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home. i now know where i will be staying every time i have business in this city, and anyone i know who is doing the same will hear so.
deceptive	amazing and beautiful! i stayed two nights here and the room was immaculate. all of the staff were extremely nice and welcoming. the food was delicious and fixed to perfection. the entire hotel was clean, warm and inviting. will definitely stay here again and recommend to any of my friends traveling to the area.
truthful	we loved our stay at the talbott. we were in chicago to attend the theater show dirty dancing. we booked our room through orbitz and received a nice discount. when we arrived at the hotel everyone from the doorman to the front desk to the maids were highly professional and courtesy. we were upgraded to a king bed suite. the suite was well decorated and spacious. my wife particularily enjoyed the heat that could be directed at the marble floor in the bathroom. we loved the hotel and will definitely stay at the talbott on our next trip to chicago. highly recommended.
truthful	i travelled to chicago last week with my daughter for some christmas shopping. we booked the conrad based on the reviews on tripadvisor. it lived up to all expectations. great big room, with two king size beds. very comfortable. breakfast was great, loads of choice and plenty on the plate. great location, connected to a shopping mall which was very useful the day it snowed. all and all, a great hotel and we would go back in the morning. chicago is a great city with very friendly people.
truthful	i haven't stayed all that much with hyatt and i'm not sure if i will be going back anytime soon. the staff was very professional and helpful. our room was close to being 4 stars; however, fell a little short. it really is time for a remodel of the bathroom. the toilet was of an older and flawed design where you had to close the lid to flush. i'm not a germ freak or anything; however, i really don't want to have to constantly have to touch anything on a toilet if i don't have to. the hotel was fully booked with a teen convention (fccla) and unfortunately for anyone else we all suffered for it. the noise at night from every direction. the only way to describe it was as if every room around us was having a slumber party. coming back from dinner one night it took twenty minutes for us to get to our room due to the traffic. with little to no supervision the kids would cut in line to get on the elevators or they would jump floors not to mention having teens going floor to floor to visit with one another, absolutely ridiculous. the lobby of the hyatt at night was a complete zoo. during our second night i finally had enough and called to complain only to be told the hotel was fully aware of the situation and that there really wasn't anything they could do. ...read more
truthful	my daughter and i woke in the morning wanting to go swimming. when we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum. i then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool, one white phone and one emergency red phone, to call the desk. both were out of service!!!! i am glad there wasn't an emergency. as we were exited the pool area i ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean.... never heard back.
truthful	i wrote an email to the sales & reservation team a week ago.........i'm still waiting for a response. all i wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer. we have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails. shame you missed out, coz we tip like rockerfellers!!
truthful	i disliked the sofitel so much we changed our week stay to the grand hyatt after the first night. we checked into our suite and was blasted by the smell of body odor immediately. we were tired from our flight, but went downstairs to change rooms. the second suite smelled just as bad, but stayed anyway. i disliked the hotel lobby, the staff, the decorating, and especially the bed. horrible. soft, flimsy mattress. we come to chicago frequently. we have always stayed at the grand hyatt and never been disappointed. we just thought we'd try some place new. never again. back to the hyatt or four season we go!
deceptive	me and my husband got married here. we loved the atmosphere of our suite. it felt like home away from home. they have a nice pool. the rooms were clean and the staff was courteous. thanks so much for doing such a great job with our wedding. amy c. of los angelas, california
truthful	very pleasant front staff, wine in the evening in the lobby, large rooms, great rates, and free internet for those that are members of the loyalty program. overall an excellent value. close to the el for those coming in from either midway or o'hare airports.
truthful	i usually stay at the hotel monaco but stayed at the allegro because most the monaco was booked. while the allegro is similar to the monaco in it's decor (less traditional and more funky interior) it is not nearly as nice. the linens are not as high quality as the monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice. the rooms are also smaller. the main reason i would not recommend the hotel though, is the bathroom. it has an old tiled floor, with an old sink, and old toilet. it reminds me of something you would find in a men's locker room. although the allegro has installed a nice mirror, it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance. also, the layout of the bathroom is terrible. the toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet. also, the room is not very clean as well. the floor in my room was dirty and i found crumbs in the drawers. i would recommend staying at the monaco, hard rock, or soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice.
deceptive	the omni chicago hotel is one of the most beautiful hotels i have ever had the oppertunity to visit. not only are the desk clerks very helpful, but you feel like a celebrity when you visit. the workout room is great with lots of room so you do not feel cramp. they also have a great indoor pool and a spa. it also comes with 2 sundecks to get a nice tan. if you need a vacation, this is the place to stay.
truthful	used this hotel the first time i was in chicago. for the prices and for being classified an intercontinental...i wouldn't consider it that good. the rooms were solid. the view was ok (but so is it virtually everywhere else on michigan ave.) the service was ok. the prices were ridiculous for everything from wifi to well everything else. we came here for a jewish/hindi wedding. appetizer was fine. main entree was a small portion of meat with forgettable everything else. dessert was inedible. i have been to some other expensive hotels with similar ratings but they had more or just better rooms to an extent that it would be worth it. i personally preferred the conrad. better prices and better service.
deceptive	i truly am not the sort of person to write a negative review about an establishment, but my time spent at the affinia hotel in chicago forced me to do so. it was to be our first trip to chicago since i was a boy so my wife and i were very excited to arrive and begin our short weekend getaway as soon as we checked into the hotel. first i must say that the counter help was far less than helpful. the apparently confused person who was to sign us in was extremely out matched when it came to the workings of the hotel computer and was total inept at customer service. he said we had not reserved a room, which i had weeks earlier, and proceed to explain to us that his hotel does not make mistakes of this kind and that we must be mistaken as to the reservation or the hotel or both. finally the manager arrived after i insisted on his presents. he did straiten out the confusion, but the room we were lead to was much smaller than we were lead to believe and had not even been cleaned from the last occupants. i called down to the front and demanded that the manager walk himself to our room and see the condition of the place. we were shown to another room, this time to our liking. from that point on nothing and no one that we saw or had contact with worked or acted as one would expect from a hotel with the reputation that the affinia had. to list just a few; the television was a 13 inch black and white which could get only 4 channels, the food that room service brought up was cold, lifeless and bland, the cleaning person knocked at our door at 5 in the morning every morning even with the 'do not disturb' sign on the door, and there was this ever so slight smell of mold and vomit which passed through the hallway every time my wife and i lift the room. to be blunt, i truly hope that the ceo of the company reads this note and fires the entire staff, guts the building thoroughly, and is publicly flogged in a downtown park. we will never step through the doors of the affinia again.
deceptive	"if you are traveling to chicago and need a place to stay, i highly recommend the hotel allegro chicago. it was visiting time visiting chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the hotel allegro. he said they were pet friendly,which was a huge plus. this is because i hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time i travel for business. upon my arrival, i was met with friendly valet who treated me like i was the only customer who mattered. i walked in and saw a hotel like no other i have seen before or after. the lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place i could relax in. after i had entered and checked in, i saw the staircase, which looked like a testament to the staircase in the ""titanic"". frankly, i was amazed and i had not even entered my room yet. my room was a queen deluxe room and it was amazing. the bed had a blue headboard,which i have never seen before, and the colors worked together so well i seriously contemplated living there. the room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food i ordered. later i wanted to get a drink and i enjoyed it at the bar 312, which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. these are the specifics of my stay, but there is much more to be experienced that i did not mention if you visit the hotel allegro. in summary, they allow pets, the service is amazing, the decoration superb, and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. what more could a person ask for?"
deceptive	after reading good reviews about the affinia hotel in chicago, my husband and i decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our 30th anniversary. unfortunately, the hotel missed the mark for us. i did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a 4-star hotel. because my husband and i have had a bad experience with bedbugs, as a rule, we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel. when i brought this to the attention of the front desk staff, they practically accused us of planting the bugs there. i was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled. needless to say, we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary. i have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation. i have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that i will be refuting the charge for the one night the affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline.
truthful	"i stayed at the hotel during the dave matthews caravan tour and would come home each night rather dusty/dirty from being at an outdoor concert with 200,000 of my closest friends. i used half a bottle of shampoo the first night. the second night, the staff had not refreshed my bar soap or shampoo. i informed the front desk who made apologies and said they would take care of it immediately. i got home that night with a tiny tiny bar of soap (hand soap) for the bath/shower and they had replaced the shampoo in its original place, nicely displayed, but with the exact same bottle of shampoo that was now 1/8 full. yeah!! the hotel is in a great location to navy pier and michigan ave....i'll grant them that....but that's where their ""pros"" end. i'd rather stay at a hampton inn. i would not recommend this hotel to anyone."
truthful	before booking this hotel, i did read the reviews, and i was concerned. i ended up booking it based on my sisters recommendation. big mistake!! the temperature in chicago was a balmy 99 degrees, and the temp in the room that they gave us was about 85 degrees. when we called to complain at 11:00 am, they told us to turn the temp down to 40degrees. we went back at 7:30pm. it was still humid, the beds were moist & the room very stuffy. called again, they sent somone to fix it, & he recommended getting a new room, because the room will not cool down. they told us they were booked, yet, after the maintenance man called, they suddenly had a room available, go figure? so they move us to another room, guess what, it is 85 degrees. again, they told us to turn it down to 40, needless to say, it never cooled down & we should have just slept on the street. we travel a lot, and we stayed here one night, and it was awful!!. at check out, i had to re-tell our entire room issue, they actually ended up not charging us for the night, thank god they did not offer us anothers nights stay, because we would never go back. also, the room decor is very old and stuffy. if your going to chicago, don't stay at the millenium knickerbocker!!
truthful	we stayed here for one night, and found it a hotel that concentrates on conferences rather than your normal guest. we found it hard to get a room in the city for that particular night and so we paid above the odds for this - @ $200 for the night. we felt when we checked in that if you weren't with the conference, then why were we staying in the hotel. the guy at the main door didn't even hold it open when you are trying to lug your bags into the lobby, we then had to que for 15-20 minutes just to check in. we were not given any information about the hotel and when i rang down to reception at one stage to find out if there was a business centre in the hotel that i could access the internet through, i was just short of being asked why didn't i bring my lap-top with me so i could use the internet access in the room.... !! i found the staff very rude and not helpful at all and would not recommend this hotel for a tourist.
deceptive	this is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the chicago river and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city! i had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in-room massage and fantastic room service. if you're looking for a vacation in chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort, i highly recommend this hotel and i would definitely come again!
truthful	"as we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said ""we picked the right place."" having chosen the talbott from other trip advisor reviews i found myself thinking in terms of a trip advisor review when we arrived. nice entrance, friendly reception, i noticed everything and immediately knew the talbott was a non-corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains. the smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of europe, simple, not overstated but elegant. the location is great, there was light snow but we walked to the art institute, rush street, the theater district, and we're from california where anything below 50 degrees keeps us inside! all i can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort, class and somewhere unique, stay at the talbott. oh yeah, we were in a room that looked down at the construction, we were on the 15th floor and could not hear a sound, it was very quiet."
deceptive	i made my reservation at the hilton chicago believing i was going to be staying in a classy hotel with many amenities. unfortunately, my stay at the hilton chicago went downhill from the moment i checked in. there was only one clerk at the front desk, and several guests already waiting ahead of me. once i finally got checked in and located my room, i discovered that neither of my room keys worked and had to make my way back to the front desk. finally i made it into my room. it appeared nice enough until i went to use the bathroom and found the toilet clogged. the manager moved me into a new room, so i can't complain too much, but still it was a hassle. finally settled, i was able to relax for the rest of my evening and was looking forward to sleeping in the next morning. that is -- until the front desk called me at 5 am with a wake up call i had not requested! needless to say, my overall experience with this hotel left much to be desired and i will choose other accommodations for my next trip to chicago.
deceptive	this was a great hotel, one of the nicest that we have stayed in a long time. my wife was absolutely thrilled with the staff and we couldn't believe the kimptonkids program at the site. we will be back next time we stop in town. we cannot think of a better place to stay.
truthful	fairmont hotels are generally my preferred choice, but this was a true disappointment. check-in was quite slow and problematic (glitches with their reservation system locally). room was very small and oddly arranged. felt quite cramped in room and was hard to work at very small desk. hotel overall felt quite cold and isolating...lobby is not at all inviting, and it didn't feel terribly safe walking around outside. gift shop was overpriced, even for a downtown hotel. food was disappointing. overall this seems greatly overpriced and does not meet usual standards of a fairmont i've come to count on. bill was completely messed up and required 3 separate calls after i left to straighten out.
truthful	our first visit to chicago and i really cannot wait to go back. the hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful. particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful. the room was clean, quiet and spacious, if only every hotel were like this.
truthful	"well, this used to be a le meridian hotel, and it has changed for the worse. we kept having to remind them we booked a package, because we were being over-charged separately for everything, when it should have been included. we were supposed to have champagne in the room upon arrival, and did not. two phone calls and three hours later, it finally showed up. we tried to have a drink in the bar, and even though we were the only people there, three servers/bartenders came and went, talking to each other, not one of them acknowledging us. after ten minutes we left the hotel and went down the street for a drink. and don't bother to pay extra for ""city view""; because you may get the view we had from only the sixth floor, looking across the street directly into a plain brick wall - that is all we could see. oh yes, the valet lost his cell phone in someone's car, and called me at home today to see if we found it. he wanted me to call him back at home. nice of the hotel to give out our personal information to the staff, huh? for the money, stay at any other hotel in chicago with the same price-point and it will be much much better."
deceptive	the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is my favorite place to stay in chicago! i travel to chicago very often to visit my son, who is training for the u.s. navy. they make every stay feel like a luxorius vacation. the indoor pool and sauna are amazing, and i never have to miss a workout because the gym is fully equipped. if you dine at the lb bistro, you must try the eggs benedict :) the staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel of this stature.
deceptive	my husband and i came to the ambassador east hotel for my sister's wedding. the hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests. when we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were, helping us check and get our guests situated. they were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest's rooms. our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed, with a view of the city. we held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall. after my sister was married in a church downtown, we held the reception in the large banquet hall. again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner, the dj and all of the wedding's decorations. we had a great time. ambassador east hotel is highly recommended!
truthful	my family and i have just had a two week holiday in chicago, and we stayed for a week at the hilton towers. we had a fantastic time and enjoyed every minute of our stay at this incredible hotel. the sheer size of the place is breathtaking and the atmosphere is very friendly and hospitable. if you prefer discreet modern boutiquey-type hotels, maybe this wouldn't be your thing. however if you enjoy old style glamour and glitz, you will be bowled over by this hotel. the place literally sparkles thanks to the enormous chandeliers that are everywhere in the lobby. tons of celebs have stayed here over the decades and the history of the hotel and past guests etc is fascinating. we got a very reasonable rate for our stay and could not fault anything about this very special place!
deceptive	i recently stayed at the amalfi hotel chicago in chicago, illinois. i must say, that staying at this hotel is like staying at a high end hotel for celebrities. there are spa packages, room service, and the hotel is decorated extremely beautifully. i would recommend this hotel to anyone that is looking to be treated like a star. they take reservations, and also have a great restaurant right inside of the building. whatever you need, they will accommodate you. this is heaven on earth! i would recommend anyone to stay at this hotel, even if its for one day, its worth it.
deceptive	"i've never written a review before, but i just had to share my experience with chicago's intercontinental hotel. i booked a weekend at this hotel for my wife's birthday. we've never stayed at a luxury hotel before and i thought this would be a great experience for us. the horrors started when we first got to the counter. the clerk mixed up our rooms and when i pointed this out he got really snooty with me. we get to our room and the maid hadn't cleaned it yet! we had to wait around for that, so we went to the hotel's restaurant and the food was terrible and overpriced. finally our room is finished and the the ""view"" we were promised was non-existent. to top it off the maid did a terrible job cleaning. the toilet was dirty and we actually found a stain. a stain! on the sheets. what a waste of money. i pointed this out the concierge and we weren't even offered a refund or discount. never again."
deceptive	for the price, you would think this would be a top quality hotel, but it was nowhere close. service at check-in was slow and unfriendly. the room was even worse. it was small, dirty and smelled like stale cigarette smoke even though i had requested a non-smoking room. the cover on the bed was stained, there was hair all over the bathroom floor, and the curtain rod was almost falling off the wall. everything looked tired and in desperate need of a remodel. i also didn't appreciate having to pay for wifi, when other premium hotels offer it for free. overall, this was one of the worst hotels i have stayed at in a long time, and considering the price, it was terrible.
truthful	will not stay here again. we were here pre-construction so didn't have the noise problems that others are now experiencing. but room and service quality were so poor that we will not return. our suite was large enough, but it was dirty, dated and worn. the bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly. public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days, disgusting. we (politely) requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed. we had paid for the king tut package, which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit. they had no record of this and didn't honor it. of course, the exhibit was sold out, so our main reason for visiting chicago was ruined as we weren't able to see this part of the field museum. my (also polite) letter to hilton and the manager was never acknowledged. very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding hilton in general when possible.
truthful	our stay was absolutely perfect. its a cool hotel to look at, the design and feel is very trendy and hip. all the staff are terrific, especially the consierge staff-great info and attitude. our room was on the top floor, with great views. super comfy bed, and neat bathroom. fantastic, choose this with no hesitation!
truthful	this hotel was magnificent! not only was it a mini palace, but the staff was polite, helpful, and professional. in an e-mail i received before we left for chicago, the concierge, les, offered to get us tickets, directions, reservations to anything we'd like to see/do. he also got us an upgrade on our room, and when someone rudely butted in line as we were registering, the registry person said they would upgrade our room just for that. and so we were granted a beautiful suite complete with king size bed and jacuzzi. the bed and the linens were so comfortably both of us slept late every morning!
truthful	this is a great hotel! the views are fabulous, the service it friendly and the location is superb. we booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the chicago river. the only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped. we booked our room for $89 a night for memorial day weekend. it was a steal! i highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning!
deceptive	great hotel!! the staff is very friendly and helpful. the room was in perfect shape, very clean and just a beautiful setup. i will definetly go to this hotel many more times when i am in the area! i would definetly recommend it!
truthful	we stayed at amalfi for 2 nights and i have to say after reading all the reviews here i expected a little bit more. it's a fine place with clean bathrooms and comfy beds but it's just not worth the money. it does have comfy beds and free continental breakfast. the sheets though, made us itch for some reason and we are normally not sensitive to these things. the breakfast could really benefit from some bagels or yougurt. otherwise, it's just an early morning sugar attach of muffins, danishes, sweet breads, and croissants. there are plenty of restaurants around but they are all of the big chain variety, if you are into that sort of thing. also, the windows do not open and there is a climate control device in the room. the problem with it that it keeps blowing air all the time, alternating between cold and warm, right over the bed. there is a sign not to turn it off but we did once just to see what happens and the air in the room got uncomfortably stale. they do have a business center where you can send fax and use internet for free. the problem is it is only one tiny room with one computer in there. one person at a time... all and all, we will not stay there again. if we feel like luxury, we have to find some other place. but if we feel like a regular hotel in the heart of the city, maybe we will try red roof inn or something like that. at least we'll know what we are paying for.
truthful	"we travel to chicago frequently and have stayed in many of the hotels downtown. we were excited to try the swissotel, but left disappointed. the actual hotel and rooms were very nice with amazing views, the staff was extremely rude. the man that checked us in was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until he was done with his phone call. he then did not say more than five words, which were ""i need a credit card"". the lobby bar had fireplaces and was very cozy. the hotel information said it closed at 2am so we came back to hotel at 1230am for a ""night cap"", that was last call. that was fine for us, but the bar was full and many people were coming back from their night wanting a ""night cap"" but did not make last call. our night ended listening to many unhappy people complaining and receiving no sympathy from the employees. there are many places to stay in the area that are just as nice or nicer, no need to stay at the swissotel again. definitely don't stay if you're looking for a romantic weekend away, the employees will ruin your experience from the second you walk in the door."
truthful	my fiance and i traveled to chicago for the first time this december and we were not happy with this hotel. the friendliest people on the staff were the bell boys. they greeted us with a smile and gave us lots of great advice throughout our stay. the rest of the staff however was terrible. when we first checked in, i was instantly discouraged. the front desk person was not in a good mood and i couldn't wait to leave the lobby. having not traveled here before we were looking for exciting places to eat and to go sightseeing. we asked multiple staff members at the front desk of places to go and see and never got any good recommendations. we felt as if we were an inconvenience to the staff. at one point, the front desk person was on the phone while we were waiting to talk to her, as she was on the phone a family of four came up behind us waiting to talk to her as well. even though she saw us standing there, after she finished with the phone call she ignored us and helped the family first. yes, we are in our mid 20's, but we are still paying guests and there is no reason to be treated like we are invisible. for how much money we paid for each night, i would have rather stayed somewhere else. we decided to go with this hotel because of the location and the great reviews, but we did not experience any of this during our stay. the rooms were alright, but nothing special. i would not stay in this hotel again.
truthful	"here are my experiences: - had three rooms reserved, when checked in we were charged 2 different rates for the rooms - screwed up initial room assignments, gave us a room that was not even cleaned yet when we checked in - could not get us new keys to a different room without great difficulty (we had to go to the front desk because bell staff went to the wrong room to give us new keys) - in room guide says pool in on the 8th floor and signs say it is on the 7th - could not get to the pool from the 14th floor without going all the way down to the lobby and then had to go to the 7th floor and take the stairs to the 8th - when we checked in we had the front desk staff go over which credit cards were assigned to which room. - when we received our bills, the credit card assignments were still wrong. i stay at ""economy"" hotels a lot and i have not even come close to having this many problems with a hotel until this one. this hotel should do chicago a service and just close its doors. due to this experience, i will never stay downtown again to deal with overpriced hotels with poor service and surrounding business that are just as bad."
truthful	we stayed two nights. we were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant. he was very cold. our room was very, very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days. the room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet. we were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink, the door to the bar was locked. we called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn't and were told they were short staffed, 'sorry'. what?? are you running here? you are a hotel in the country's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? this was our first and last visit to a kimpton hotel.
truthful	"we stayed at omni chicago for 2 nights in early july (july 1-3). the reason we chose this hotel was simply because of a great deal we got on travelzoo. we got pretty good rate that included a valet parking and vouchers for food&beverages. i also signed up for their loyalty program, which was so worth it. i was concerned at first that we would be treated like a second-class guest because of the price we paid. but i was totally wrong! they treated us extremely well. before our arrival, i got an email asking if we needed anything. so, i asked for a fridge to store the baby milk. and they arranged it for us without charge :) we arrived late on thursday night. our room was ready for us upon our arrival with the fridge i requested. we were given a corner suite on the 10th floor...very nice room...comfy bed. my husband was really wowwwww!!! the bed was made ready for us - both in the bedroom and the sofa-bed (we didn't use the sofa-bed though). we got a high-speed internet as part of the loyalty program. all staff were friendly and helpful...front desk, valet parking, bell boy, room service, concierge,... everyone! we used the voucher for room-service breakfasts both morning. the first day was great. food was great, and quick. we also got complimentary beverages as part of the loyalty program. we ordered oj and hot chocolate. they both were so good that we ordered them again the next morning. but we were very disappointed that the hot chocolate tasted pretty horrible. it tasted like left-over coffee mixed with water and a bit of chocolate :( also, we ordered belgian waffle for our breakfast, which was supposed to come with whipped cream and strawberries...but we got a plain waffle. so, we had to call the restaurant and wait for a while to get those. this is why i didn't give ""5"" for service. however, i reported these issues to the front-desk when checking out, and the front-desk staff took care of it by not charging us for that meal. another thing is that it's quite noisy at night even though we were on the high floor. we could hear siren going on & off during the night. but this is out of the hotel's control though. and i would say that it didn't bother us at all. my baby could sleep very well. overall, we really enjoyed our stay, and would definitely consider omni for our next trip to chicago."
deceptive	"a friend and i stayed at the hyatt regency in chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her birthday. the hotel at first glance was very nice and charming. but, we quickly found out that was not the case. our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in. the bathroom was filthy, it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks!! there was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror. there were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room. we immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly, unkempt room. the women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling ""was not smoke"" because that is not permitted in the hotel. we were also told that room was cleaned that day. after several minutes of arguing with her and a manager, we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time. we had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us. the food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and way over priced. our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there. all the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests. i will never stay here again and i would never recommend this hotel to any one."
truthful	stayed at the chicago affinia dec 10 thru dec 12 and was very impressed with the staff, the room, and the location. close to shopping and the pizza place next door was great. of course, there were many other restaraunts nearby as well. i had a little trouble figuring out the heat, but it was fine once i learned how to set it. they were working on the hotel, so we got a great rate. but the work never bothered us. the room was great, with the walk-in shower in the spacious bathroom a wonderful surprise. i would definately stay here again and would recommend to others.
deceptive	after staying at the omni chicago hotel, i can honestly say that i will take the time to book a room, ahead of time, on my next visit to chicago. we were thrilled to see how beautiful the hotel was, at first because it seemed like it would be a nice place. the outside of the hotel was pristine, but our room was filthy! we requested a non-smoking room, but it had obviously been smoked in before, as you could still smell the stale smoke in the air. in fact, we were told that the entire hotel was supposed to be non-smoking, but the hallway smelled like cigarettes as well. to top it off, room service brought us the wrong item. when we checked out, we saw that they still tried to chage us for the item, even after we sent it back. i would also have to point out that michigan avenue is a bad spot for a hotel that claims to be so high class. right outside of our hotel were drug dealers and prostitutes. i couldn't even go to the gas station after 8 p.m. because i was too scared to leave the hotel. the pool was closed on our first night there because of some convention that the hotel was holding, thus keeping us from using the hot tub that we were looking forward to. for the price of the room i would say this place was a definite disappointment. i have learned my lesson to check out the room before i agree to stay in it next time. this place gets 1/2 of a star from me.
deceptive	i stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago last year and can say i was not satisfied with my experience. i feel that it didn't live up to what was advertised and the accommodations were sub-par at best. i had the chance to catch a show and the music was too loud and the sound guy's work resembled that of an amateur. my personal rating is 2/5 stars and i would not recommend this hotel to a friend.
deceptive	the palmer house hilton is located in the heart of the theatre, financial and shopping districts of downtown chicago. it is walking distance to museums, shopping, government and corporate buildings. the location makes it perfect for visiting chicago. the rooms are luxurious, with super comfortable beds and soft sheets. the rooms was clean and quite nice looking. the hotel's restaurants are amazing. the hotel would definately exceed your expectations, whether you are a business traveler or there on vacation.
truthful	"i have been meaning to write a review of the omni but wasn't sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high. we stayed here for 5 nights. the room was fine when i walked in. but about five minutes or so i was all congested. thought it might have been from the flight. i then noticed there was dust everywhere. the tv, the minibar, and worst of all the air vent. it was literally hanging off the vent. i called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up. after 30 minutes of waiting and noticing other things. a bathroom door that wouldn't close, broken light fixtures, a toe or fingernail on the bed. broken bathroom fixtures. this place was a dump. hopefully the pictures will show some of it. i could go on and on. almost 90 minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room, both he and head of housekeeping were ""shocked"" at the room. we were moved to another room, not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked, or so i was told. i stayed at the omni once prior and have to say was very impressed. but this will be the last time. sad to say. the hotel did cut the rate of our 5 day stay, but doesn't explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection."
deceptive	my family stayed at this hotel and walking into the lobby i expected a very good experience. once i made my way to the counter and was greeted (not really) i knew this may be a bad experience. the customer service person was rude and did not wait on me for a few minutes. once i got up to the room it looked like someone had just checked out. the high chair that we requested still had spots of food on it. the rest room had water on the counter and very little toilet paper. after we got settled we went down to the dining room for supper and was disappointed in the service and the food quality for the price we paid. luckily we only had to stay there one day. one day was almost too long.
deceptive	a recent stay at the james hotel-chicago, revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only. although the rooms and public areas look nice, the hotel still needs serious work. our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non-smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke. we asked for a new room which was clean and odor free. we had to involve the manager before our request was granted. the new room was better at first glance, but was severely lacking. we could not get the temperature properly regulated. the room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay. in a hotel commanding the rates of the james, we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted, not something which is a constant battle. our mattress was horribly uncomfortable. when the rooms were updated, the james skipped new mattresses. ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can't get out of--when you lie down, you sort of sink into a hole. this matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a 'luxury' hotel. last, but not least, we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay. in spite of the calming decor, the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night's sleep. all in all, we were unhappy with our accommodations at the james chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location. you will be happier almost anywhere else.
truthful	"i arrived and my friends were already there and visiting a nearby art gallery. they put my name on the reservation and told me to get a key from the front desk when i arrived. the front desk staff gave me the key to my room and i put my stuff away and went to meet the group. we returned late that night and i soon realized the room that my friends were in was not the room that i placed my stuff in that afternoon. we went to speak with the front desk. we were met with ""we can't do anything about that right now due to the hour. we will not disrupt the guest staying in the room you say you left your stuff in."" unacceptable!!! my $1500 laptop and all of the things i brought with me were in that room! not my mistake! finally, after arguing with the head of security for about 30 minutes, they knocked on the door of the room i had left my belongings in and a lady answered. she was upset and stated she had security take the items from her room in the afternoon. all of my belongings were recovered in the security room; however, all of this hullabaloo could have been avoided had they communicated about the situation! terrible, terrible customer service. they sent up an apology letter, champagne, and chocolate covered strawberries to the room. although i was appreciative of the gesture, it still does not excuse the fact that they argued and continued to say ""we can't do anything about it."""
deceptive	i was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the sheraton, but a recent stay at their downtown location in chicago was somewhat of a disappointment. it started with check in; i had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed, but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms (ok, rather rudely!) that because of some banker's convention that was going on, i should be happy with the double-bed room that was left. it was all i could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience! the room itself was ok, nothing special though. the cleaning staff must've just been through, because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air. the internet jack wasn't working. it took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it, no apologies given. for the price, i really expected more in the way of customer service from sheraton. i guess they're really no better than anyone else these days!
truthful	i was attending a training conference in chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held. i booked 4 nights at the intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location (an easy walk to the conference). from the lobby to the rooms, this hotel lives up to it's storied reputation. (the indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a busby berkeley movie!) and even tho' i was there for a conference, the hotel's location on the mag mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters, made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price.
deceptive	i booked a room at swissotel chicago because i thought the price was reasonable, and at the base price it was; however, it ended up costing more than i had planned for, as you have to pay for parking and other amenities. the service was not very good, considering they market themselves as a luxury hotel. there was no one there to help us bring in our bags when we had a difficult time doing so, and the staff were cold. all in all, i would say it was an average experience... not luxurious like they claim it to be.
deceptive	i was really looking forward to a nice relaxing stay at the end of a long vacation, but unfortunately that was not to be had. from the moment we arrived at the omni, the staff was belligerent and extremely rude. they had lost our reservation and refused to give us the rate we had booked before. if we weren't so tired, we would've gone to a different hotel right then, but hindsight is 20/20. after we finally got checked in after being made to wait needlessly for 45 minutes in the lobby, we decided to go down to the pool, which was tiny and kind of dirty, so we had walked all the way down there in our suits for nothing. the internet access was really slow. i will never stay here again. save yourself the headache and book somewhere else!
deceptive	recently stayed at the james chicago and will not be returning anytime soon. the staff is unfriendly to say the least and the prices are outrageous. also not a fan of the fact they allow pets as guests. there wasn't enough space in the gym and the lack of variety in equipment limits your options severely. ultimately i was very unimpressed with the services as a whole and would recommend you avoid this establishment.
truthful	we were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills. our room was such a pleasant surprise, from the flat screen tv, the full size shower with rain showerhead & hand held shower wand, the wall attached toilet with flushing options (on the wall), the comfortable bed, the lovely lighting options, etc.. the size of the room was snug, and very comfortable, as would be, in a historic hotel. it was also quiet, and i know that the hotel was sold out. my sister was in the room next door. we did not hear her tv. we also loved walking less than a block, to the shopping and restaurants on north michigan avenue.
truthful	i was really excited about staying at the amalfi after reading several reviews online. unfortunately, it was a very disappointing experience. when we arrived, we were told that there was a mistake and the hotel was oversold. so, we had to move to another hotel. amalfi did take care of the other hotel, cab fare, and after much negotiating...breakfast. we were traveling with 2 children and all of this was very inconvenient. instead of getting up the next morning and going to the museum as we had planned, we had to get up, pack up our suitcases, check out of the hotel, take a cab, check back into the amalfi, only then could we head to the museum. we were also told that our first night's stay would be refunded. well, more than 3 weeks and 3 phone calls later...there still hasn't been a refund. i can't even get a manager to call me back. the amalfi wasn't all bad, it is centrally located close to train and bus stops and has many restaurants within walking distance. the coctail reception had a nice selection of drinks and appetizers. however, it was in a very small room and there was no place to sit both nights we attended. one reason we picked the amalfi was that it had 2 queen beds instead of doubles, but they seemed really small for queens. our view from our room was of the alley. so, overall the best part of staying at the amalfi was the night that we were sent to another hotel and had a wonderful view of the city from the 22nd floor. very disappointing indeed!
deceptive	oh my goodness, this has got to be one of the worst places to stay in all of downtown chicago. it all went well enough checking in, but them went downhill. there was so much left to be desired. the biggest problem was a huge turd in the toilet, i kid you not! i guess the maid was rather busy that day or took a break and forgot about it, i just don't know. but for the prices they charge, this type of thing is unacceptable. most everything else about the actual room was as expected. the noise was a bit more than i'm used to though, but there was a convention of college age kids staying on the floor above us. so we asked to be moved to another room, they did get us in another room, but that took nearly 2 hours. the second room worked out well for us, but i won't be risking staying here again. plus the pool was not available, i really wish they would have mentioned that on their website, i was looking forward to it for days. all in all, it is a beautiful place in a wonderful location, but they need to work on their customer service before i'll reconsider staying at the homewood suites by hilton chicago downtown.
truthful	in a very nice location close to shopping and places to eat and also in a beautiful neighborhood. a small hotel with a pleasant place to sit in the lobby, the pump room is a classic place to have a drink. we did not have dinner there so i can not comment but we enjoyed people watching while we had an afternoon drink looking out the window at the people in the neighborhood. it is a short walk to very good shopping and eating.
deceptive	superhigh bill at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago my wife and i decided to take a weekend getaway to celebrate our anniversary. i told my wife that i would take care of everything. i booked the millennium knickerbocker because it had a great location, it was reasonably priced for a 4 star hotel and had spa features. the hotel loby seemed nice enough and the staff seemed fine. the problems for us started when we went to our room. i have sinus problems, so i didn't notice the smell in our room, and my wife didn't say anything to me because she wanted to go with the flow and not ruin our weekend. we couldn't find the remote for our television and we didn't call down, we were trying to be good sports. we were both disappointed when we realized that our hotel didn't have a pool or hot tub, swimming and relaxing in a hot tub is one of the reasons we go on vacation. upon checking out i was hit was 250 dollar fee for smoking in our room. my wife and i don't smoke and there was nothing we could do to get out of the smoking fee. if that wasn't bad enough we were hit with a 50 fee for the missing remote control.
deceptive	we recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park while travelling for business. what an incredible experience! friends had stayed there years ago, but when we showed them our photos, they couldn't believe the amazing renovations. while we loved the modern decor and style, our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call fairmont pure rooms. i have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling, so i wasn't too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy-free room. i have to say i felt great during our entire stay. we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at eno. what a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel. this hotel is truly beautiful, everything you would expect from a high-end, big city hotel. our stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park didn't disappoint us in any respect. our only disappointment? we don't have a reason to go back to chicago anytime soon, but i have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future.
deceptive	after searching for the perfect hotel for my chicago getaway i knew once i came across the hard rock hotel, that this was the hotel for me. after seeing the exceptional accommodations the hotel offered, i booked my reservations right away. when i arrived at the hotel i was astonished at how beautiful and big the building and grounds were kept. i was greeted warmly by the front staff and received my room key within a few minutes. i was also given helpful pointers to nearby attractions and restaurants. i took the elevator up to my room, and when i opened the door my jaw dropped as the views of the chicago skyline was impeccable. after relaxing i went down to the bar for a few cocktails and was impressed by the fast, courteous service i received. after my cocktail hour, i decided to unwind and let me tell you the beds must be sent from heaven. i had one of the best nights of sleep i have had in a long time. i highly recommend the hard rock as i have stayed at many around the us and this is definitely on my top 5 list. hope you all enjoy it as much as i did, and i can't wait to return. ashley b.
truthful	the conrad hotel is a beautiful hotel. our room was perfect and beautiful in every way. i was very impressed (and i am hard to please and have high standards). it was so clean, aesthetically pleasing, up to date, just gorgeous! i would definitely stay there again. i loved it. the location is superb too, attached to nordstrom and northbridge mall. can't wait to go back!
deceptive	the hilton chicago boasts to be one of the greats but falls into a cliche of a hotel. there are many different rooms with a supposed array of choices from king with two bathrooms, lakeside view or suites. it only looks good on paper that is until you get your bill. you will pay a huge fee for what seems like a nice upgrade but gives you nothing in return! the staff is nice but when i stay at a hotel i do not go out of my way to seek out the staff. the casual dining atmosphere might be nice for a college couple looking for a getaway but it will not be cheap. next time i stay in chicago i will be looking elsewhere.
deceptive	my friend and i visited amalfi hotel last week when we were in chicago and found it to be a great place, very sophisticated and luxurious, with lots of attention to detail in the decor and wonderful customer service. the beds were comfortable. the room service was great as was the gym... i fully enjoyed the views from the hotel room... so beautiful at night... the city scape. and in the morning, the free continental breakfast was delicious. it was a wonderful experience being at the amalfi hotel in chicago. i am eager to visit there again.
deceptive	my stay at the ambassador east hotel was a pleasant one. i loved being able to take a quick stroll to michigan ave for some shopping. i also loved the pump room. what a fun place to hang out and enjoy a blood mary. the front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost. they found me a room immediately even though the city was book up. i thought the rooms were clean and well maintained. the shampoo was great and i decided to take it home with me. i am looking forward to another stay at the ambassador east in the spring when i return to chicago.
truthful	let me first start by saying i have always been pleased with the conrad hotels and that is why i chose the conrad chicago. i was very disappointed in the level of service. 3 phone calls to get maintenance to fix the bathroom sink, unpleasant experience in the terrace resturant, front desk not aware of room eminities, and a very uncaring mod! all the conrad hotels i have stayed at have been 5 star but not this one. i have to give it 2 stars!!!:(
truthful	i can easily say this is one of the worst hotels i've stayed at the. the receptionist up front was a snooty, sarcastic teenager or post teenager. you can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner. the room was dirty, stains on the carpet, the showerhead was moldy and rusted, the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches. the towels had a horrible aroma. the hotel is very narrow, so we were near a construction zone so, i would plan on waking up at 6:am if you choose the talbott. the next day, i asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room. that room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop. i asked for late checkout at 1pm and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day, if were not out by noon. i had to speak to the manager who gave us till 1pm. please stay away from this hotel, i think a holiday inn would be better. andrew f. gulli
truthful	the room was very spacious with very nice, colorful decorating. the beds felt like lying on a cloud, and there were four pillows on each bed, two fiberfill and two down so you could choose which you like better. the bathroom was very nice also. overall, i was very pleased with the stay. you had to show your room key to get in after ten p.m. i thought that was a good security issue. it has a great location too, close to downtown. i would recommend it. the decorations were very classy. most hotels have two of the same framed art, boring bedspreads and lumpy pillows. the hyatt regency was just the opposite.
truthful	the swisshotel is awesome. very high class. it is expensive , but so is every hotel in chicago. it is off from the dingy areas of our city , yet a long walk to navy pier, so you will need to pay for the cab. note to all the magnificent mile is boring as can be. i live in chicago and the hotel is a better experience than the mile of navy (boring) pier.
deceptive	we booked a room at the hilton chicago for two nights to stay the weekend, but upon arrival our reservation could not be found. i even provided the hotel with our confirmation number, but it still wasn't available! fortunately, another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us. once we settled into our room for the night (after a long flight), there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom. apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re-clean it after our arrival. needless to say, with both of these poor experiences in just one night, i will be hesitant to ever stay in this hotel again, let alone any other hilton around. please consider someplace else before the hilton chicago!
truthful	i stayed at this hotel for a week with my family this hotel is huge so clean has comfy beds foods great staff couldn,t of being any nicer. stayed here for thanksgiving it was fabulous second time in chicago and still want to go back again ... the hotel is within walkin distance to both state street and michicgan avenue.there,s taxis right outside the hotel and the concierge can also ring for mini buses if your travelling with a big crowd.there,s also a cinema 2 mins away opposite the hotel . perfect hotel for a great get away ...
deceptive	my husband and i were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the conrad hotel. for the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite. upon arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist. not only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name, but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she couldn't spell! our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me. we ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food. it was alright but nothing out of this world. we felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere. all in all the conrad was a big disappointment to both of us.
truthful	how about this had reservation confirmation in hand and still had to argue with the registration desk about price on reservation. she tried to charge me price on bill they slide under your door. sorry not on my watch! then about this room you gave me i understand this place is old but for the price you charge how about some indoor plumbing! you take a shower and the tub fills with water will not drain this is absolutely redickulas for this being a hilton i think you should step back and take a look at how this place is operating. registration: fail parking price: fail plumbing: fail thank you hilton for for my super 8 experience in chicago.
truthful	i stayed here for 2 nights in may 2008. i have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky. they had a free wine tasting each evening! the restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay. the hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping / restaurants and sights! rooms were lovely, althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side. will be back.
deceptive	"my family and i stayed here while we were visiting chicago. this was a perfect location to many of the things we wanted to do and was easy to get around. it was in a safe neighborhood and was great accomodations. the staff was friendly and went the ""extra mile"" to make sure we had everything we needed. the beds were comfortable. we would definitely stay here again."
deceptive	"as a former chicagoan, i'm appalled at the amalfi hotel chicago. first of all, i was expecting luxury and hospitality, neither of which i received. there's an experience designer who is supposed to be like a ""personal concierge,"" but my experience with my ed was terrible. i felt like he was trying to pressure me into staying more days than i wanted to. not only that, but i couldn't understand what he was saying most of the time because he was talking so fast. when i finally got to my room, i was disappointed with the quality of the furniture and the room's cleanliness. i had to ask for a maid to come and give me clean towels because some of the towels in the bathroom were damp. on top of that, the bed was messily done; i could have done a better job on my own bed at home. i was angry at this point, because i was paying a lot of money for every night i was staying at amalfi, and i didn't expect to be greeted with wet towels. i needed to use the wi-fi to download some important documents, and the internet was surprisingly slow. even a very basic hotel or motel could have offered better, maybe even faster internet access. when i finally checked out of the amalfi, i made sure that my supposed personal concierge knew all of the problems i'd had with my room and the hotel. i was glad to see the amalfi getting smaller in the mirror as i drove away!"
truthful	went there for business and the hard rock hotel on wacker drive was recommended. i was to meet my girlfriend there who had arrived 1 hour before me. when she go there at 6pm, the room wasn't ready, the phone didn't work, the shower didn't work. when i got there she was already very upset. i called the manager to complain, but was put on hold for 30 min. i could hear everything in the room next to me as if there wasn't any wall separating us. i asked for a wake up call, but nobody called me the next morning. when i called to complain the next day, the told me the phone system was down. ordered room service and got the wrong order... the building is very old and the elevator sounds like it is on its last breath... i would not recommend it to anyone patrick
deceptive	great hotel. went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time. the hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at. beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery. great staff and wonderfull food as well, i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work.
truthful	my husband and i were in the fairmont chicago recently for a conference. we stayed in a spacious suite. all amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape. the bed was very comfortable. views were great. i love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights. the room was so quiet, it was very relaxing. we ate in the restaurant downstairs (aria) and although pricey, it was excellent. the staff were consistently attentive and responsive. it is evident that everyone is very well-trained. i would love to stay here again.
deceptive	"i stayed at the hilton chicago during a recent business trip. i elected to go with their executive suite upgrade. all i can say is, ""what upgrade?"" it's barely anything above what you get normally. and for the price i paid, i was expecting much better acommodations. because i arrived around 10:30 the night i checked in (delayed flight) i did not get the concierge service as it stops at 10. i find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you're expecting a guest who has not checked in yet. beyond that, it took them 20 minutes to get me into my room. first it was a room mix-up, then it was a missing key card. that was extremely frustrating as i was tired and i had a presentation to give the next morning. speaking of the next morning, the complimentary breakfast was a joke. when i just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast, i'll stay at the next super 8 i find. and the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed. i will not be staying at the hilton chicago every again even though i frequent chicago. this tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot."
deceptive	grant it, this hotel seems very nice, but i was not at all pleased with my stay here. the customer service was horrible. i had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either. for as much as i paid to stay here, you'd think the least you'd get is an iron. not! i had to request an iron, too! in addition to all of the failed amenities, i was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and wasn't reimbursed until an entire week later. the next time i choose to visit chicago, swissotel will be the last place i think to stay.
truthful	"i reserved the ""rock star"" suite for my boyfriend's birthday months and months in advanced. when we arrived at the hotel monaco, they told us that they doubled booked the room. this was after many emails to the hotel inquiring about the room and if it was available. they tried to make up for it by providing us with a room with a wonderful view of the river and giving us a ten dollar gift certificate to their resturant - which we didn't even use. i felt we were taken advantage of because we were young. the doorman didn't make us feel any better when he told us that it wasn't the first time they did this for the ""rock star"" suite. however, the conceirge was incredible with providing us with a bottle of champagne for his birthday and delivered the birthday cake i ordered. if it wasn't for the room confusion - it would have been a wonderful stay."
truthful	our third stay at the homewood suites chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two. the staff are consistently friendly, polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door, servicing the rooms, managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk. they genuinely seem happy to be working here and can't do enough for their guests. the rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other (we didn't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy). the hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on michigan ave, or catching a bus or subway. there is a jewel osco and a trader joes each within a couple of blocks, which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc. my husband heartily recommends 'binnies beverage depot' for a huge variety of beer. now all we need is an excuse to return to chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the homewood suites, because we wouldn't stay anywhere else!
truthful	the ambassador east was a average hotel at best, and mediocre at worst. the bright spot is a very helpful and friendly staff. the doormen and the concierge were especially helpful and willing to do what they could for you. the room was lackluster, however. the bathroom was in especially bad shape. it was dirty when we arrived, with hair in the sink and shower. the shower was in really bad shape. the shower head adjustment did not work properly and water pressure was very low. the water temperature did not get warm during the first morning of our visit. the decor throughout the hotel (lobby, hallways and rooms) was very out-of-date and old-fashioned. i would have liked there to have been a vending machine in the hotel as well. the business center with free internet access was a nice feature that was easy to use. the hotel's location was okay though it was a bit of a hike to the most popular tourist destinations. i would not stay at this hotel again based on its current conditions, but if it underwent some renovations to update the rooms and the bathrooms, i might be inclined to stay there again. ...read more
truthful	just returned to seattle after a visit home to chicago and i loved the james!!! recently stayed at the ritz at water tower and the dana around the corner--both of which were great but the james was perfect. secured the room through a package w/ american express for a great deal so though the view wasn't great the space, decor and location can't be beat. staff was friendly, courteous and very helpful, the gym was substantial and though i didn't try the restaurants/room service, the menus looked yummy. i've stayed in chgo in that area on avg 1-2s/mo over the past three years and the james is at the top my list now. if you can get a good deal, i highly recommend!!
deceptive	i recently stayed at the ambassador east hotel for two night, and my visit was nothing short of disappointing. expecting to have a wonderfully romantic weekend with my fiance, we specifically chose this hotel because we prefer boutique hotels for the extra attention from the staff and unique atmosphere. our expectations for the ambassador were not met. the room was small and, frankly, outdated. the bathroom smelled musty. the a/c in the room had two settings: polar cold or off. the walls did nothing to muffle sound from adjacent rooms, and it was loud at night - a good night's sleep was impossible. staff were indifferent. do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel. frankly, it's not worth the steep price and mediocre character. since there are far better and more accommodating boutique hotels in chicago, i know i won't be back at this place.
truthful	"the location is amazing, right across from nordstrom's on michigan avenue. the hotel is beautiful and the rooms are clean. but... we are intercontinental ambassadors (the rewards club) and to get to the ambassador suite level, we have to ride a private ""express"" elevator. the elevator took three minutes to get to the thirtieth floor. when we checked in, the person behind the counter was rude and acted as if we were lucky to get checked-in. also, there was a language barrier becuase she was russian. the pool and spa were both beautiful, but we had to pay an extra fee because of ""upkeep"". if you want a nice hotel all the way around...go to the omni."
truthful	"booked through hotwire and consequently was placed in a room where we barely had room to walk around our luggage. the 'view' was of the 'inner courtyard' of nothing but walls of windows of the other rooms. you were unable to determine what the weather was outside except that it was either day or night. they no longer have in-room coffee appliances. you either have to go down to their ostentatious dining room, or go around the corner to starbucks or mcdonald's. internet access is not free ($12.95/24 hours), the ""gift shop"" is a joke (tucked away in the corner of the coat check room, concierge services have limited hours, and the business center is open only during 'business hours' which made it difficult to get work done after 'business hours."" i would not stay there ever again, nor do i recommend it to anyone. i have had better stays at any holiday inn express!"
deceptive	the experince at the hard rock hotel in chicago was fantastic,i will rate them a 6 out of 5. they have wonderful service and great staff and the view is just wonderful.
truthful	the bathroom toilet leaked water all over the bathroom every time it was flushed, so we called maintenance to have it fixed. we returned to our room only to discover the maintenance personnel had left a nasty mess in the bathroom and the toilet seat was covered in grease. there were dirty clothes all over the bathroom and they even used our guestroom towels to clean their hands and tools. we love chicago but we are never staying at this hotel again.
truthful	"i can only confirm the positve reviews previously mentioned. we stayed in room 1112, king with river view. no noise and very comfortable.the price was a bargain at $191 a night. i would stay here again. the ""l"" from midway airport lets you off about two blocks from the hotel. it's a $2 ride - no need for a $40 taxi ride."
deceptive	i will never stay at conrad chicago again. the employees were rude from the begining. when i asked for extra towels the lady at the front desk looked like i was an inconveniece. the bar staff wasn't much better. the maids never came and changed our sheet during our stay. do not go there!
truthful	well located and well staffed. the amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay. it lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by. free continental breakfast and evening cocktail.
deceptive	hyatt regency hotel: good ole downtown, chicago. hypo-allergenic rooms are usually intended for the well-being of even the worst cases of allergen sufferers. well, when we got to our room, one of the first things my wife did was sneeze four times. upon setting up the channel scanning which, the reception came in fuzzy all around, there was an interattive ethernet feature that after, lost in confusion of how to work it, provided us with our first fee! the pool was in bad shape. the maids seemed to come and go with no intercommunicative qualities.. just knock knock knock. we let em' right in as they started vacuuming. one of the fluorescent bulbs on the ceiling was dimmer than the others and the gideon's bible had crib notes. what a room! not to mention what the hotel was like! oh geez.
truthful	just returned from a 3 night stay at the talbott. this was our first visit there, and i can honestly say that i wouldn't stay at any other hotel in chicago. from when we first were greated by the bell captain until our final departure, the staff was nothing less than amazing, always greeting with a smile and can i help you attitute. the room we had (1508) was very spacious and comfortable. the bed was probably the most comfortable that my wife and i have ever slept in (including the four seasons). had great breakfasts and drinks at basil's. you would be missing a fantastic experience, if you didn't stay at the talbott.
truthful	"we booked thru hotwire which we have a high percentage of positive outcomes. i was very happy when we saw that we would be staying at the knickerbocker-as i had stayed when i was younger. we reserved a king non-smoker. upon arriving we were told that they did not have that and we only had the choice of a smoking room. when argued they stated ""well you booked thru hotwire so you do not have priority"". as we entered the room i noticed the bathroom door was off track and the bathroom light did not turn on. we called the front desk and they fixed the door but not the light. later that eveing as i took a shower the seal around the shower was so poor water got all over the floor and towels. also, i must add the room reaked of smoke. the next day when we checked the front desk clerk asked how our stay was and when we told him the problems, he told us the total and had not concern of our issues. we also checked in our bags for the day, and the bellmen came quickly and made very rude comments about us hurrying up so he could get on with his day. we realized a bit later that we forgot something in one of the bags and was told they would not get them back out. stay away-even if you get a good deal!!"
truthful	we arrived for a weekend stay and really enjoyed the hotel. the cocktail hour was so full of people that we could not get in. the second night we went earlier and it was very nice. the staff was very helpful and had a good knowledge of the area. the rooms were modern and very clean. we will stay there again.
deceptive	the sofitel chicago water tower in the downtown area is advertised as a four-star luxury hotel. however, modern architecture and a convenient location seem to be its only reliable perks. room service is available 24 hours a day, but offers a limited variety of items and often lethargic service. two bars are located on the premises, which is appealing at first. once inside, patrons do not receive the quality of service that is to be expected and there is a complete absence of privacy, of any kind. the guest rooms are relatively spacious and clean, but a lack of adequate toiletries and personal items can interfere with a guests routine. obtaining additional towels and grooming products is much too difficult. if you are a traveler who is in search of a relaxing and hassle-free experience, with reliable customer service, booking a room here is probably not a viable option.
truthful	"everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money, they have excellent customer service, the employees there really cared about their guests, there was always coffee, tea, hot chocolate in the lobby, good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer, the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions, the room did the job, there was a kitchen, 2 flat screen tv's, and a pullout couch included, it was close to the ""el"", but for us we found the buses to be more useful. i would recommend getting a pass, we got a 3 day pass and it was well worth it for $14 which we got at jewel osco, not too far from the hotel, for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families, but us three girls didn't mind, so i would definitely recommend this place, it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels."
truthful	elegant lobby, comfy beds, nice sheets but, we were given a (not fancy, a little dated) room on the 5th floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure, and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night. at the hilton, one is charged for internet access on each device per hour. (we stayed in the middle of ohio and received total access for free.) we didn't drink the $6.00 water or try the $28. breakfast buffet. the staff was friendly, but of course you tip for a smile. they did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a fold-out couch as we were a party of 5. didn't use the gym or pool on the 8th floor, but looked nice (small pool.) no view of the water possible, though we were right at grant park. we tried to view the fireworks from a higher story, no such luck. ...read more
truthful	after reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo, i decided to give this hotel a try. i must say it was a great choice! the location is perfect, just off from n michigan ave, walking distance from everything. the staff was very helpful and friendly, and the room was excellent. they gave us a corner room w/a great view. as many have posted, the bed & pillows were very comfortable (i am very picky about that). i slept well every night! the renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit. i highly recommend this hotel.
truthful	stayed here with friends for a long weekend in august and loved the hotel. enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour, and the accomodations were quite nice (our beds were very soft and comfortable). we had excellent views of the river from our rooms. the location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town, with easy access to public transportation nearby. my friends actually received the goldfish upon request, which they enjoyed. some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above, but it was minimal. price seemed very resonable to us for the location. will certainly return to the windy city and plan on staying here again.
deceptive	the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is a magnificent grand hotel. the size of the rooms, and the views of the city are phenomenal. at night the city lights up, and the sight is majestic. the hotel itself, and the employee's are wonderful, and well worth the pay to stay in such a place. this hotel has so much to offer, great dining,a fantastic gym set up for those of us, who really like to stay fit no matter what we are doing.my wife and i have just left recently, and we are already planning to stay there on our next trip out. big thumbs up to those who run that place, and helped us enjoy our stay.
truthful	do you imagine getting there for the first time and overlooking the room, that was supposed to be ready, with used towels and the mouthwash opened and used? what about when they left the towel for the floor (the foot towel) to dry my face? what about the slippers that, although being still in the bag, had all the sole broken and left tiny plastic parts over the way to the garbage (all over the room, de facto). i didn't realise that would happen to me until i saw paris hilton on tv and then i knew god is great and he did it to us for being such an idiots to go to a company that has been able to create her. shame on us, actually!
truthful	the only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other kimpton hotels. it was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee. the robes were not in the room and it took a long time (hours) but other than that a great place. the concierge was excellent.
deceptive	great hotel! went to see the museum of contemporary art which was great, but this hotel almost had it beat! the rooms (and even halls) are very beautifully done. great service too. a+
truthful	the good - excellent location, neighborhood is pretty and quiet, close to shops, restaurants, the waterfront, close to train/subway station, etc the bad - very old decor, which isn't a big deal, but the tv was smaller than my pc monitor. we were supposed to have a king bed (anniversary trip) we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened. the shower/tub was stopped up so bad that after i showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower. who wants to shower in someone else's dirty water even if it is your wife. the indifferent - room was a decent size, bed linens were okay, staff was mediocre to marginally rude
truthful	the room wasvery tiny and was very warm. they give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do. the bathroom is small. the tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review, and does crackle under your feet. i, personally, did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality. the public areas are nice and are good to hang out in. this is basically an old hotel that has been updated. the comment about the closet is true, it is actually indescriable. you can hear everything occuring in the other rooms. the location is convienent but so are many other hotels. if you do stay, fly into midway, take the orange line, you cannot go wrong.
deceptive	this hotel was worth every cent. you have not experienced chicago luxury until you have stayed here. in town for a conference, my colleagues and i never had to leave our hotel for much of anything. fine dining, entertainment, you name it: knickerbocker's got it! i will definitely return as my wife and i frequent chicago to visit family.
truthful	"the staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact. the ""welcome back"" sets the tone for your stay. flowers in the lobby and reception area beautiful. the house-keeping staff is terrific, helpful and prompt. room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too. pump room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients. well done!"
deceptive	this is the best hotel to stay in when visiting chicago. i travel a lot, both for business and vacation. the talbott hotel is a cozy yet stately hotel that is handsome, and elegant. not to mention all the modern features that i'm used to having at home, are available in the room. i brought my wife on my last business trip and we stayed in the one bedroom suite. she didn't even want to leave the room. the concierge was especially helpful in finding us a romantic place to go for dinner.
deceptive	"my wife and i recently stayed at the hotel monaco in chicago and, after our experience there, we will not be returning. with a hotel that markets itself as ""luxury,"" we were expecting to get a big bang for our buck. we were disappointed, to say the least. first of all, we stayed in the king deluxe room and it was uncomfortably small. the space was used poorly - my wife and i could not walk around the bed at the same time because there was so little space. the decor seemed rather dated and not of the best quality. although they said our room woudl be ready at 3, we had to wait almost an hour past that for our room to be ready. although the staff did offer a complimentary drink as an apology, they didn't seem terribly upset or apologetic about the inconvenience this caused. the noise at night from the city is horrible - even with the radio on in our room we could hear traffic and pedestrians on the street well past midnight. the hotel would not move us to a different room. all in all, i felt that we paid $100.00 for a luxury hotel and got a $40 motel 6. we will definitely not be back anytime soon."
deceptive	i have been stayed in allegro for two days. there are not other big prolems but one thing i'm not satisfied with is the light. it is dark in the room. also in the bathroom, the light is not good. i have to open curtains. i have complained about this to their reception. they said they will fix it, but i did not get any response. i am very disappointed and i will never come back again.
truthful	a very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms. the decor was lovely. my daughter and i spent 5-nights here, saw wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town. was a bit disappointed with the bar/restaurant which opened and closed it's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours. the room description boasted of safe's large enough to accomodate a laptop, so i brought mine. i was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room (and not in mine). as a side note, i was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area... even the 7-11.
truthful	we have just returned from a week at the james chicago. the hotel is fabulous, very chic and chilled. the service is beyond compare. check in and out were swift and painless. the concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay. the hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in chicago - voted by chicago residents. we stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city. the room (a deluxe king) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies, hairdryer, safe, tv, robes & slippers, a very interesting selection of minibar items (one of which was a real surprise!) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella! we also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with kiehls products and a cosy little dining area. the ipod dock/cd/radio and complimentary chillout cd were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv. the super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary wifi allowed us to plan our next day's activities from our bedroom. we were so busy touring around the city we didn't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab. the bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more. staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available. the barman mixes a mean mohito ! this hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g. the virtual tuck in service - basically a couple of pcs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they're away from home on business. also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends. next visit to chicago i'll definitely be staying here and wouldn't even consider an alternative if the james can maintain these standards.
truthful	the hotel is in a good location. it is very contemporary in decoration. beautiful flowers in lobby. the room service was very good. concierge services were also very good. we were treated well. the shower water pressure was very poor. also, at checkout our room bill was conveniently not available so they mailed it to us, which we were charged for the 3rd night when our room was actually prepaid. it was courteously taken care of after contacting hotel. bar was very small and uninviting and there was very poor selection for appetizers/food. read more
deceptive	the james hotel in chicago is by far one of the best hotels that my family and i have ever had the pleasure of staying at. the room service is the best in the area, not to mention the spa in the hotel is to die for. the lobby and the reception area is very contemporary. this is a great place to take the family to relax. i would recommend this hotel to anyone. 5 stars!
truthful	having had a great stay at the monaco last fall with friends, i was disappointed (initially) to arrive on saturday with husband and find that they didn't have our quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for sat. eve. but they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following: found us a nice room at the neighboring swissotel and paid for it! gave us cab fare to get the 4 blocks over there. paid for our valet parking $33 that eve. so naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for sunday eve (when they did have room), we said yes. when we returned, they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our $139 quikbook rate! now that's what i call a recovery!!
deceptive	i recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the hotel allegro chicago to attend a corporate meeting. to say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. i stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. my room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. a fully stocked refreshment center, wet bar, and lcd hd tv were amongst the standard items. the allegro is in the center of everything, the chicago loop of the financial district, the chicago theatre district, great shopping on slate street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel (i suggest the 312 lunch club). the fitness room is well equipped and clean. the professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the allegro. my next visit to the chicago area will definitely include a stay at the hotel allegro chicago.
deceptive	our visit started off on the wrong foot when we entered the lobby struggling to carry all of our luggage and, instead of helping, a group of hotel employees stood watching and laughing at us. they had trouble locating our reservation. our room was tiny! when i'm paying over $400 a night for a room, i expect to be able to walk around in it! the beds were also tiny. the walls were thin and we could hear our neighbors talking next door. this hotel was probably once beautiful and classy, but now it seems to be outdated and due for repairs. won't be staying here again.
deceptive	my family and i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers with the belief our stay would be a 5 star experience. that was the farthest thing from the truth. the staff was very rude and unhelpful. the hotel is so large that you will get lost if you dont have the help of the staff. once we did find our room our card would not get us in and we had to start all over. so overall it took over an hour just to get us in a room. as we entered the room we noticed a foul smell that we just overlooked because we were happy to just finally be able to rest. my wife went to the bathroom, and to our amazement there was what appeared to be dog hair all over the tub and tile floor. that was just the beginning of our bad stay. after being in the room for about 30 minutes, there was a knock at the door that just happened to be the chicago police. there was a report of the smell of marijuana coming from the room! my family was put through a series of embarrasing questions and actually had our luggage and personal belongings searched. there was a small amount of marijuana found in the drawer of the dresser that we never touched. come to find out after video surveillance, the cleaning lady was arrested for possession of marijuana. needless to say, our stay at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers was the worst part of our vacation and i would not recommend anyone to stay at this place.
truthful	i loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown chicago, an older hotel with a great reno (a bit over-the-top design, but still very lovely and charming), clean rooms, and very friendly staff. they're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb mastiff cross with a gift bag (treats and directions to an off-leash area), and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog's names on it.
truthful	i loved this hotel - fabulous old building but with first class modern amenities. great location, as it's so close to both lakeshore and city. chicago is such a walkable city, so this was a superb base. the staff were just lovely - so very friendly and efficient. the room was wonderful - very, very comfortable and exceptionally clean. great chair. great coffee. lovely bathroom with a huge, absolutely fantastic shower. it was also extremely quiet. that, and the best bed ever, meant i slept so well and since i was there for a week, that was very important to me. yummy martinis at the martini bar. i will most definitley be back!
truthful	"after reading all the lukewarm reviews for this hotel, i went ahead and got an ambassador membership just to hedge off any unpleasantness. i normally have a good experience with intercontinental hotels, particularly the mark hopkins in sf. i called the hotel directly to confirm that my reservation was designated as ambassador club. when i arrived at the hotel, there was no separate check-in line (as advertised) and the manager on duty basically ignored me when i told him i was an ambassador club member and stuck me with a regular tiny room. i was nearly half an hour checking in the room and had to deal with the arrogant attitude of the manager on duty. they gave me a room in the ""modern"" tower, (built in the 60's) which was about 2/3 the size of a regular room at the mark hopkins (built in '29). i had to deal with torn sheets, cracked marble sinks, and the spare roll of toilet paper being located outside the bathroom inside the closet - how convenient is that? the closet door, if you are not careful, may break the full length mirror attached to the bathroom door. i was not provided with a key to the minibar and i called for turndown service, which never happened. the next day, they finally got around to the fact that i was an ambassador club member and entitled to an upgraded room, but since i travel with a medical device which i already set up in the tiny room, i declined. to their credit, they did send some of the amenities i would otherwise be entitled to as an ambassador club member. i would not stay at this hotel next time i go to chicago. there are other better places for the money including, the omni, the james, the fairmont, hyatt, sheraton, monaco, crowne plaza, even the holiday inn and marriotts located in the same general area."
deceptive	i stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town. it was a little pricey, but definitely worth it! the staff was super friendly, the pool was clean and well-maintained, and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs (i'm a vegetarian). plus, i paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous. i would definitely recommend.
truthful	we stayed at hotel monaco and upgraded to a suite. i was disappointed with the room layout, and shabby furniture. i bumped into the coffee table and the top almost crashed to the ground. the make up mirror in the bathroom didnt work, the tv reception was very poor and overall the room just wasnt worth the $450 we spent there. next time, we will go back to trump tower across the street, which is far superior to hotel monaco.
deceptive	extravagant, exuberant experience! our stay at hotel allegro was very enjoyable. the intoxicating views made the get-away much more relaxing, as well as the exceptional room service. the rooms were very decorative and well above par. i very much enjoyed the complimentary tea. i would highly recommend hotel allegro as a must stay vacation get-away.
truthful	"we stayed at the ae for two nights for a three generation ""girls weekend"" (grandma, mom and daughter). i looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us. then i called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named reece. rates were a bit high for the saturday night portion of our stay but when i requested the american girl package, he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate. the american girl package was perfect for us. my 8 year old daughter was thrilled. they give you a doll bed, a backpack and a travel kit to keep. they have matching bathrobes for girl and doll (you don't get to keep those). she also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu. our room, 1334, was large and clean. it had two double beds with nice linens, two chairs, a desk and a clean bathroom. the employees are all very friendly and helpful. we had a drink in the pump room but did not eat there. we ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the 3rd coast. this hotel is north of michigan ave. but it is just a short, pleasant walk to the mag. mile. i would definately stay here again in chicago."
truthful	we had our hotel reservations at another hotel set and after we were reading all of the negative reviews we cancelled and made out reservation at the hilton - i am so glad we did the hotel was clean, hotel staff was pleasant and helpful and the beds were amazing. we knew we were paying a little more than some other hotels but it was well worth every penny.
truthful	just got back from three nights at the knickerbocker. went up to chicago for some last minute christmas shopping. hotel is in a great location. north end of michigan ave. about half a block away. staff was very nice and professional. everyone we came in contact with was very helpful. granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets. we were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room. good size room, with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed. bathroom was somewhat small. housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day. did not eat at the restaurant nix, but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar. overheard comments saying the food was very good. drink service at the martini bar can be slow. martinis run $9 and up. very good drinks and they don't shy away from the liquor. valet parking was $35 a day with in/out priviliges. overall a great stay. would definately stay at this hotel in the future.
deceptive	i was not at all impressed with my stay at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago. checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 (one!!) front desk agent 30 minutes to process. both guests had issues with their rooms regarding, it seemed, wrong room types and being out of the room type requested. i was nervous about my own reservation and, sure enough, my superior corner room wasn't available. the hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available. i was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel. want internet? upcharge. want extra pillows? upcharge. extra coffee for the room? upcharge. bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating. i won't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking.
truthful	this comes a little late as i'm finally catching up on my reviews from the past several months:) a dear friend and i stayed at the hyatt regency in late october 2007 for one night while visiting a friend and her husband from out of town. this hotel is perfect, imo. easy check in and check out. lovely, clean, comfortable rooms with great views of the city. i know this area pretty well and it's very convenient to many downtown chicago attractions. we had dinner and went clubing with our friends around division st.. we had no problems getting cabs back and forth to the hyatt and there's even public transportation right near by but we didn't bother since we only needed cabs from and to the hotel. parking, as is usual for chicago, was expensive but we were able to get our car out quickly (however, we left on a sunday morning, not exactly a high traffic time although it was a bears homegame day, so a bit busier than usual i would think). no problems at all and the best part is that we got a rate of $100 through hotwire, a downright steal for this area of chicago and the quality of the hotel.
truthful	this is about the fourth time we stayed at the allegro. the previous times, i have nothing but good to say about the allegro. but my reaction has soured on this place. we have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in december as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping. from the very start, this year was a disappointment. i had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the allegro. i was quoted one price (higher than what was on line), when i mentioned this, i was told i could have the lower price. at check in, the desk was nice but not friendly. we discovered that our room was not as good as in the past (punishment for asking for a lower price?) the closet had no hangers, we had no place to put our suitcase. no one mentioned the wine reception in the evening. on the second day, we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing. it took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one. i wrote the management following our stay. i have yet to receive a reply. needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time. i would advise others to do the same.
deceptive	i was very satisfied after staying at the sofitel chicago water tower. the service was excellent, as the staff was very helpful and polite. the beds were very comfortable, and the rooms were very spacious. i will definitely be returning to this hotel.
deceptive	my husband and i were planning our 1st year wedding anniversary and we wanted to go back and spend it in chicago where we had first met. after spending several minutes frustratingly navigating the talbott hotel's website, i finally was able to complete a reservation for a long weekend. after a long flight into chicago, we were so ready to check in, shower, and lay down in our hotel room. however, once we arrived the unfriendly clerk behind the counter notified us that we did not have a reservation. i provided her with the confirmation email and she again said there must be a mistake because the room we reserved was already occupied. she begrudgingly found us a new room after what seemed like an hour of waiting. we then carried our own bags up to our room only to immediately be hit with a rancid smell of cigarette smoke as soon as we opened the door. i'm severely allergic to smoke and we ended up getting a refund and locating a much more accommodating and friendly hotel.
truthful	we stayed at the swissotel for a special birthday weekend for my wife from aug 25 to 29. i had called ahead to ask for a nice room and to order flowers for my wife. jaymes ballard, the concierge, made arrange for flowers, early check-in and we had a great room. our room was the 33rd floor with a view facing the city. room was large, everything looked like new, great bed, large bathroom with separate shower, great ammenities. a beautiful bouquet of flowers arrived upon our arrival. the hotel is about 10 mins from everything, not close but not far from anything. has a great restaurant, 2 patios outside where i had a cigar. a really nice pool and hot tub on the 42nd floor. i would recommend this hotel to anyone and thanks to jaymes for making our trip very special.
deceptive	i was in town to visit my cousin an stayed for three nights at this wonderful hotel. its so close to the shopping i wanted to do with my cousin , granted i had a personal guide a.k.a. my cousin janice. the amenities were unbelieveable an the service was great with the upmost hospitality. would recomend to everyone great for kids an adults. the room and view were spectacular, the beds were very comfy and the room was emaculate.
truthful	guys trip to chicago, scored this hotel on priceline for $100 a night. had a little confusion over the bed situation at first. they said they only had kings available even after i had called and requested 2 doubles. after a 30 minute ordeal at the front desk they put us in a room with 2 doubles. the room was nice, nothing specacular, a little on the small side but nice. the lobby was beautiful to look at but that's about it. hotel is within walking distance to soldier field, sears tower, espn zone, and lots of bars and restaurants. great location that and the price we got the room for made our trip. would definately try and stay at this hotel again.
truthful	i stayed here for 5 nights last summer. i booked the reservation on priceline for $75/night which was the cheapest rate i could find anywhere during a convention week. anyway, when i arrived at 11 pm from the airport, i was told that they had overbooked the hotel and had no room for me. they booked me at a dumpy 2 star motel by the airport. they gave me $20 for a taxi to get there, and it cost me $35. i was late for a meeting the next morning because of the extra travel and packing/unpacking. the millennium offered no compensation whatsoever for their foul-up. no free drink, no room upgrade, nothing. since i booked on the internet, i was chopped liver. beware.
truthful	"our check-in was great, but then we got into our room. the carpet was drenched and stained near the bathroom because the shower (open concept) leaks water onto the floor since there are no doors on it. the mini bar was broken and put an extremely foul scent into the room. our final hotel bill reflected 2 charges that were incorrect....1 for the mini bar which we did not utilize, and the second was an up charge for a bottle of wine ($69 instead of $50). when my husband went to the front desk to have it corrected, he was met with a very unfriendly and unapologetic employee. it was adjusted, but not without confrontation. there was another guest checking out when my husband was at the front desk who had the same ""mysterious"" mini bar charge on her bill as well, and was trying to have it corrected. overall, the location of the hard rock was nice but it will be the last time that we stay in one,"
truthful	i checked in at the affinia hotel in chicago shortly after dinner on tuesday, i was greeted by very frendly staff from the valet service to front desk. you can tell people were happy at the hotel. i was pleasantly surprised when i got to my room. the room was very well decorated and well thought out. the furniture was in the right location and there was lots of space. plus it was convenient with lots of power outlets the bedroom and washroom was very clean and i had a great sleep in their very comfortable bed. i was told by front desk i could choose from 6 different pillows, although i did not take advantage of this offer i thought what a great idea. once in a while you come across hotels with great service, well thought out rooms in a perfect location (right off magnificent mile). when visiting chicago again i will definitely try and stay at affinia again
truthful	we enjoyed the hotel monaco. great location for walking and beautiful rooms. the staff was so friendly and we especially enjoyed the wine reception and getting to meet other guests. will definitely stay there again!
deceptive	this is a beautiful hotel inside and outside. the rooms were very comfortable and clean. the hotel made my experience of visiting this city even more wonderful, i highly recommend this to anyone.
truthful	this a great property, excellent location and wonderful staff. everyone was very accommodating and polite. the room i had was on the 23rd floor and was like a suite, with a living area and a bedroom. the living room was spacious, with a plasma tv, a desk and a couch. the beds were very comfortable and the toiletries of very good quality. in the closed they placed an umbrella, which came in handy, it rained the whole time i was in chicago. the internet connection is $9.95/24hrs. great place, i will return for sure.
truthful	"i live in chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances. we recently put up a candidate (and his family) we were recruiting for our company at the conrad. we had had good luck with this hotel when it was a le meridien. it was a disappointment for all concerned as a conrad. on the plus side, our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room. on the downside... they learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub (only a shower). our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it, which they had to clean themselves. when the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some, they were told it would be delivered immediately. when they called 30 minutes later the front desk admitted that they had ""forgotten."" while the concierge and doorman were quite helpful, our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive. our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the ""five best hotels in chicago."" conrad has a long way to go to compete with the four seasons, peninsula and park hyatt."
deceptive	when i arrived at the millennium knickerbocker hotel chicago i was shocked at the poor and dangerous neighborhood it was situated in. this was not the chicago i was hoping for.in addition to that, it looked nothing like it did in the pictures on their website. the paint was faded and chipped, there was a foul odor in the lobby and there was no staff to speak of. after we waited for 15 minutes at the front desk, someone finally came and said that they did not have a reservation under our name. after a long trip, i'm sure you know how aggravating that was. finally i got a manager that knew how to work the computer properly and he brought up our reservation. once we got to our room, it was very small, smelled like smoke and the carpet was severely stained with either wine or blood. also, as we were walking to the room in the hallway, a cockroach walked right across our path like he owned the place. to top it off it seemed everyone staying at the hotel was a gangster or a gambler and his lady for the night. all we heard was lots of frighteningly loud love making and arguments ensuing that even a television could not mask. it was a nightmare. oh yeah, and the shower did have any hot water. we complained to the desk and they said that it was not there fault and that it would be fixed my next week. when we asked for a discount they said that there were no refunds and that we could leave whenever we wanted.
